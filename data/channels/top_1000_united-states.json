Skrillex shocked fans by dropping an additional surprise album, Don't Get Too Close, in the middle of his performance and bootleg CD copies of the project were given out to attendees at the end of the night. While there is no clear end in sight, one thing that's certain is that Skrillex's new music continues to elevate the landscape of music.\n"

This was achieved through creating light hearted animated content featuring a white marshmallow looking mascot with the iconic two-leaves on its head. The leaves symbolizing ever lasting growth. When water properly, it will sprout to be very green and big. \n\nFast forward to 2024, post covid, psych2go has built a wonderful community of young and mature people who are passionate about taking care of their mental health while learning more about how to help those around them as well. We are so proud of this amazing community that otherwise would not have existed should the decision to start a Youtube channel not happen. \n\nStaying true to our grass root approach of involving community members, fans and friends, we hope to collectively move the world into an elevated state of mental wellbeing. \n"

        "description": "This is Juice WRLD's official channel.\n\nChicago-area hip-hop musician Juice WRLD delivers introspective lyrics atop melodic production, echoing Travis Scott and Post Malone. Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018."

My name is Vivienne, and I like to animate cartoons and songs!\nI am a grad of SVA in NYC, majoring in traditional animation, and I animate films based on the silly characters I keep coming up with! I have also taken to trying to fan animate some songs every now n' then. Songs that give me inspiration or direct visuals! I adore musicals and villains and animals, can't you tell? Hope you enjoy! c:\n\nFAQ:\n\"What programs do you use?\" TV Paint for animation, Adobe premiere, After effects, Sai and Photoshop!\n\"When is your next animation?\" Animation takes time, but I'm almost always working on something! Soon as I can finish you'll see it!\n\"What are these characters you draw from?\" They are from my various projects, I have TONS of projects!\n\"Why is your taste in music such shit?\" It's cause it's my taste in music, it's not yours. I choose what songs I LOVE so they aren't shit to me!\n\nCURRENT PROJECTS: \n\nHazbin Hotel (comedy/Musical series) -IN Production-"

(Got that definition from wikipedia lol it's not my own). But if you've ever had someone play with your hair or draw on your back, which I'm sure you have, you would have experienced this feeling!! (It is the bessstttt) So my goal on this channel is to give you those brain tinglezzz and help you sleep 😴 \n\n📩 Business enquiries: marketing@hunnibeeasmr.com \n"
