Certain antibiotics, ultraviolet radiation, high sugar consumption, and poor diet can contribute to collagen breakdown and speed up premature aging. Vitamin D helps protect you against the loss of collagen and premature aging. \n\nThe most potent stimulus of collagen is exercise. Focus on the plank exercise, eccentric exercises, and sprinting. Not only will these exercises make you look younger, but they’ll also improve the health of the vessels, valves, and tissues around your heart. \n\nThere are several anti-aging foods that you should add to your diet to prevent premature aging. Adequate vitamin C intake is essential to form collagen. Raw sauerkraut has the highest amount of vitamin C!\n\nVitamin K2 is vital for collagen and keeping your cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and fascia healthy. It also helps give your skin a youthful glow. Liver, egg yolk, and butter are the best food sources of vitamin K2. \n\nMagnesium allows your body to make collagen and helps vitamin D prevent its breakdown. Dark chocolate, almonds, and spinach are the best sources of magnesium.\n\nZinc keeps skin youthful and speeds up wound healing. Oysters, red meat, and liver contain the most zinc. Copper is also essential. The best sources are oysters, red meat, shellfish, liver, and dark chocolate.\n\nHigh-quality protein is crucial in keeping you healthy and helping you look younger. Grass-fed beef is the best source. \n\nIntermittent fasting can promote autophagy, which has potent anti-aging effects. You must also prioritize sleep to reverse aging and have a youthful glow. \n\nOxytocin is one of the most powerful anti-stress hormones. You can make your own cultivated yogurt product using the microbe L. reuteri to significantly increase this hormone. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Overthinking can trigger cortisol, which equals more stress. Stress hormones will continue to stress you out, leaving you trapped in a vicious cycle of anxious thoughts that can be very difficult to break out of.\n\nMost of the time, anxiety and overthinking can be fixed by addressing nutritional imbalances, but people are often prescribed SSRIs. These drugs block the reabsorption of serotonin and come with several side effects. They can downgrade the receptor for serotonin, which can cause a major deficiency in serotonin.\n\nDrugs, chronic stress, junk food, lack of sun, and vitamin D can deplete your serotonin and dopamine. Many people get the blues during the winter months because of a lack of vitamin D from the sun. \n\nVitamin D deficiency can lead to anxiety and depression. Research has shown that vitamin D may produce the same results as a medication for depression without the side effects!\n\nThe health of your microbiome directly affects your mental health. The microbes that help increase serotonin are very sensitive to broad-spectrum antibiotics. \n\nTo stop overthinking and improve your mental health, you’ll want to take at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D each day. You also need the microbes that make serotonin!\n\nL. reuteri affects serotonin more than any other microbe, yet over 96% of the population is deficient! The best way to fix this problem is to make your own probiotic yogurt using L. reuteri. This microbe can help decrease anxiety, increase oxytocin, and significantly reduce cortisol.\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

In this video, I’ll go over some common vitamin D mistakes, cover the facts, and dispel some of the vitamin D myths you may have heard. Discover the correct way to take vitamin D. \n\n0:00 Introduction: Vitamin D facts \n0:20 Vitamin D and magnesium\n1:00 Vitamin D side effects and magnesium deficiency\n1:38 Other common vitamin D mistakes \n2:37 Vitamin D dosage\n3:21 What about vitamin D toxicity? \n5:01 Vitamin D2\n5:39 Medications and vitamin D absorption\n\nDATA: \nhttps://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)29087-5/fulltext \nhttp://www.vitamindprotocol.com/vitamin-d-toxicity.html \n\nDr. Bruce Hollis Full Interview Video: \n▶️ https://youtu.be/QAQ7r6jLEww\n\nVitamin D Toxicity: \n▶️  https://youtu.be/EWZrSK4xtXs\n▶️  https://youtu.be/gjJdzHIwDDU\n▶️  https://youtu.be/uAfVC4l5uZ0\n\nVitamin D is the most important vitamin! It’s a fat-soluble vitamin involved in 10% of our genetics.\n\nVitamin D won’t work unless you have enough magnesium, the second most important nutrient. Magnesium is involved with 300 different enzymes and plays a vital role in regulating excess calcium. Magnesium glycinate supplements have the best absorption rate. \n\nThe more vitamin D you take, the more magnesium you’ll need. Some negative side effects associated with vitamin D, such as nausea, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, and headaches, are actually symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. \n\nDon’t take vitamin D without the important cofactor, vitamin K2. Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium, but you need vitamin K2 to drive it into the bones and teeth to keep it out of the soft tissues.\n\nVitamin K2 is best for calcium buildup. Take 100 mcg of vitamin K2 for every 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3.\n\nZinc is another important cofactor that helps you convert cholesterol into vitamin D. If you’re taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D, you should also take 20 mg of zinc.\n\nOne of the biggest vitamin D mistakes is not taking enough! You need at least 6,000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 every day. Vitamin D2 does not work like vitamin D3. \n\nThe vitamin D detected in the blood is not the active form. This means you could have normal blood levels of vitamin D but still have vitamin D deficiency. \n\nStatins and steroids can inhibit your ability to make vitamin D and its ability to work in your body. The best time to get vitamin D from the sun is between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 59, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Some people also refer to hyperpigmentation as aging spots, dark spots, or liver spots. \n\nThe liver doesn’t actually cause aging spots or liver spots. These spots are caused by too much melanin, which is a skin pigment.\n\nCertain things might cause you to notice more dark spots, including:\n • The summer months\n • Age \n • Diabetes \n • Pregnancy \n • Birth control  \n • Hormone replacement therapy \n • Stress\n\nA few causes of hyperpigmentation are: \n • Excess estrogen \n • Excess cortisol \n • Excess insulin \n\nMelanin protects against UV and also acts as an antioxidant. It’s actually there to try to counter all of the damage that’s happening to your skin. These dark spots are really an indication that you’re low in vitamin C and other antioxidants. \n\nTyrosinase is a certain enzyme that’s necessary to make melanin. But there are some interesting natural remedies that can act as tyrosinase inhibitors. \n\nNatural remedies for aging spots, dark spots, or liver spots:\n • Cinnamon \n • Cocoa bean\n • Grape seed extract \n • Green tea \n • Aloe \n • Vitamin C \n • Licorice \n • Quercetin \n • Melatonin \n\nThe best things to do to increase your antioxidant levels and get rid of dark spots:\n1. Consume raw vegetables and salads  \n2. Consume foods high in zinc \n3. Do fasting \n4. Avoid sugar and stress\n5. Avoid burning your skin \n6.

Fatty liver (alcoholic and nonalcoholic) \n2. Cirrhosis (scar tissue)\n3. Hepatitis (inflamed liver) \n\nOne of the top potential causes of a fatty liver is insulin resistance. You can develop insulin resistance from being on a high-carb diet or from consuming too much sugar. Late end-stage liver disease is irreversible. There is a point of no return. \n\nThere are not many symptoms of liver damage until it becomes very advanced. A large belly is a good indicator of a fatty liver. When the liver becomes fatty, the fat spills over into spaces in and around your other organs. \n\nRegardless of which liver problem you have, milk thistle is a fantastic natural remedy to support the liver. \n\nPotential benefits of milk thistle for the liver: \n• It can help protect against poisons \n• It may help reduce fat on the liver \n• It can support liver cell regeneration \n• It can decrease liver enzymes \n• It can increase SOD and glutathione (important antioxidants)\n• It can help lower insulin and improve insulin resistance \n• It may help reduce inflammation \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

I think the most beneficial methods of fasting are intermittent fasting and prolonged fasting. \n\nFasting especially targets the hormone insulin—reducing insulin and improving insulin sensitivity. Reducing insulin has incredible benefits for your health. \n\nReducing insulin can potentially help:\n • Decrease inflammation\n • Improve diabetes\n • Improve insulin resistance \n • Decrease fat in the liver \n • Decrease your risk for obesity \n • Improve metabolic syndrome \n • Support the autonomic nervous system \n\nFasting is fantastic for many other hormones as well, including:\n1. Leptin\n2. Thyroid stimulating hormone\n3. Androgens \n4. Estrogen \n5. Testosterone \n6. Cortisol \n7. Growth hormone \n8. Prolactin \n\nFasting can help support your circadian rhythms. By supporting your circadian rhythms, you’re also supporting and helping to balance certain hormones. Fasting also helps support your gut microbiome, which again may help improve your hormones. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Up to 94% of rotator cuff treatments don’t have a great success rate and require more treatment over time. \n\nThe majority of rotator cuff problems are related to the tendons, not the muscles. There are some natural things you can do to maximize the strength of your rotator cuff, but unfortunately, it will likely never be 100% again. \n\nTwo things you should never do for a rotator cuff injury are:\n1. Apply cold to the injury\n2. Rest the injured area\n \nWhat to do for tendon rehab and rotator cuff repair:\n • A hanging stretch (for arthritis with no tear or trauma)\n • Isometric exercises \n • Get plenty of vitamin D, vitamin C, and amino acids\n • Keep moving on a regular basis \n • Eccentric exercises\n • Get plenty of manganese \n\nThe most important nutrient for your tendons and rotator cuff repair is manganese. A manganese deficiency can slow down the repair of your tendons. Manganese is essential for strengthening your tendons and ligaments. \n\nThe best source of manganese is shellfish. If you’re going to take a manganese supplement, consider taking about 200 mg for around a month and then try to get it from your diet.\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

                "description": "Get access to my FREE resources 👉 https://drbrg.co/4bcnSs9\n\nAre eggs bad for you, or are they a great protein source? Find out! \n\nDATA:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566691/\nhttps://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-11-3\nhttps://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1750-3841.15892\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/14/2904/htm\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1499267116305627\n\n0:00 Introduction: Are eggs bad for you?\n1:40 Eggs and cholesterol \n2:19 Eggs vs. other protein sources\n4:20 Top benefits of eggs \n7:40 How to get the most benefits from eggs \n9:55 Check out my video on chickens! \n\nAre eggs healthy, or not? Let’s talk about what would happen if eggs were your only protein source. \n\nIn six clinical studies, it was found that eggs were not associated with heart disease in healthy people. I believe that if you had to rely on eggs as your only source of protein—you would be much healthier.\n\nEggs are high in cholesterol but also contain lecithin, choline, and vitamin B3, which help combat cholesterol. \n\nEggs are the best source of protein other than breast milk. Just one egg has seven grams of high-quality protein and is packed full of nutrients. Eggs also have a complete amino acid profile, and the nutrients and amino acids have high bioavailability. \n\nEggs are a unique source of protein because they’re not just muscle protein—they have a lot of additional factors to support your health. They even have potential anticancer effects and immunomodulation effects. \n\nEggs contain important nutrients, such as:\n • Vitamins A, D, E, K1, and K2\n • B vitamins \n • Omega-3 fatty acid\n • Sphingomyelin (helps prevents plaquing in the arteries) \n • Choline (helps prevent a fatty liver, supports the brain, and helps combat high cholesterol)\n • Lutein and zeaxanthin (supports the eyes)\n • Phospholipids (helps reduce inflammation and helps build cell membranes)\n • Essential nutrients for repair, muscle building, and helping to prevent sarcopenia \n\nDon’t just consume egg whites. Egg yolks actually have more protein than egg whites, and the yolks contain essential nutrients. \n\nDepending on your size, age, and how much muscle you have, you may want to consume two to four whole eggs to satisfy your body’s nutrient requirements. \n\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Check it out. \n\n0:00 Introduction: What is the psoas muscle?\n0:10 The effects of a tight psoas muscle \n2:45 The best psoas stretch \n5:45 Learn more about the psoas muscle!\n\nToday, I’m going to share the best stretch for your psoas muscle. \n\nThe psoas muscle connects the upper part of your body with the lower part. A tight psoas muscle can lead to low back pain, poor posture, and problems with the hips. \n\nProblems with the psoas muscle can make it difficult to:\n • Get out of bed \n • Stand from a seated position\n • Walk and run \n • Have good posture \n • Keep a low back curve \n • Climb stairs \n\nWhen the psoas is too tight, it affects a lot of other muscles, and those muscles start to compensate. \n\nTypically, a person will have a tighter psoas muscle on one side more than the other side. It’s very important to fix that and keep the psoas symmetrical. \n\nThis simple psoas stretch that I’m going to show you will also help you strengthen and stabilize this muscle. I think it’s going to give you a lot of relief. \n\nOver the course of two to three weeks of doing this stretch, you’ll find that when you walk, your pelvis, hips, and gait are more free and open. You’ll also notice that your low back pain is much better, your hips are less tight, and your low back curve is in a good position. \n\nWatch the video for an in-depth demonstration of the best stretch for your psoas. \n\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

High blood pressure \n2. Low back pain \n3. High blood sugar \n4. High susceptibility to viruses \n5. Autoimmune conditions \n6. Daytime sleepiness \n7. Depression \n\nLet’s say you’re doing everything right, and you’re still deficient in vitamin D. There are a few reasons why this could happen. \n\nTop causes of a vitamin D deficiency (when you’re already getting vitamin D):\n • Polymorphism (a vitamin D receptor mutation)\n • You’re still not getting enough vitamin D (you need at least 10,000 IU)\n • You have a problem with absorption (due to low zinc, low magnesium, a liver problem, a kidney problem, darker skin, or being overweight)\n\nWhen you take a vitamin D supplement, you also need to take vitamin K2. The correct ratio is 10,000 IU of D3 to 100 mcg of K2. Vitamin K2 can help drive calcium into the bones and help prevent it from depositing in the arteries, joints, and other tissues. \n\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Ashwagandha has helped many people feel calmer and like they can cope with stress easier. \n\nAshwagandha helps control the HPA axis, which is the communication between your hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals. These hormonal communications help the body adapt to a stress response. \n\nOnce the communication is complete, the hormone is supposed to lower back down, but with chronic stress, cortisol never goes back down and is chronically elevated. Ashwagandha can help reduce these hormones.\n\nCortisol isn’t a bad thing. It doesn’t cause stress—it’s adapting your body to a stress state. But, it’s not healthy to have your body in a state of chronic stress and chronically elevated cortisol. \n\nPotential benefits of ashwagandha:\n • It helps lower cortisol in the AM\n • It helps lower DHEA (a precursor to cortisol) in the AM\n • It helps raise testosterone (stress lowers testosterone)\n • It helps increase endurance \n • It helps increase strength (stress may cause weakness)\n • It has shown significant improvements in emotions \n\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

It’s estimated that it kills 1.8 million people every year worldwide. \n\nIt’s also estimated that about 25% of the population has been infected with TB in its latent form. Latent TB doesn’t cause any symptoms and is not infectious. \n\nOnly 5 to 10% of tuberculosis cases are active. But, 50% of people with an active infection who aren’t given any tuberculosis treatment die. \n\nSymptoms of tuberculosis (the active form):\n • A chronic cough\n • Mucus containing blood \n • A fever \n • Back pain \n • Weight loss \n • Night sweats \n\nWhat’s often missing when dealing with an infection is a healthy immune system. There is a lot of focus on treatments rather than supporting the immune system. \n\nThe problem with the typical treatment for tuberculosis is that you’re given antibiotics for months and risk developing antibiotic resistance. People with antibiotic resistance are more vulnerable to getting a secondary infection, primarily a yeast infection. Another big problem with antibiotics is that they have potential side effects that can affect a person’s brain and cognitive function. \n\nTop causes of an increased risk of tuberculosis:\n • Living in the northern hemisphere \n • The winter months \n • Low vitamin D\n • Vitamin D receptor polymorphism \n • Post-traumatic stress syndrome (high cortisol)\n • Age \n • Chemotherapy \n • Steroids \n\nVitamin D is the most important vitamin for your immune system. Sun exposure is vital for healthy levels of vitamin D. The sun also provides exposure to infrared light and UV light. \n\nFor a maintenance dose, you may want to consider taking as much as 10,000 IU of vitamin D3.

It’s the precursor to T3, which is the active form. A problem with the liver or kidneys can affect this conversion. \n\nA deficiency in selenium or zinc can also affect this conversion. There are two hormones that can not only affect the conversion but also the production of thyroid hormones—these hormones are estrogen and cortisol. \n\n90% of hypothyroid problems are really Hashimoto’s. A permeability issue with the gut can lead to an immune problem where you develop antibodies against certain things. Gluten sensitivities, allergies, and intolerances have also been linked to hypothyroid problems—especially Hashimoto’s. \n\nAnother big factor in Hashimoto’s is inflammation. If you can get rid of inflammation, I think you could see a lot of improvement. Vitamin D and selenium are important natural remedies for Hashimoto’s.\n\n7 early warning signs of hypothyroidism:\n1. Loss of the outer part of the eyebrows \n2. Thinning, dry hair \n3. Decreased cold tolerance \n4. Slow metabolism \n5. Weight gain all over\n6. Feeling tired\n7. Depression \n\nWhat to do for hypothyroidism: \n1. Determine the true cause \n2. Take trace minerals (selenium, zinc, and iodine)\n3. Don’t consume gluten \n4. Take vitamin D (40,000 IU) and Thytrophin PMG (1 before bed over three months) \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Check with your doctor before implementing this. \n\nGarlic has shown similar effects to standard blood pressure lowering medications. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what garlic can do for the heart. \n\nAdditional health benefits of garlic for the heart:\n • It’s antiviral \n • It’s antifungal \n • It’s antibacterial \n • It may help with TB and H. pylori\n • It may help kill worms and parasites \n • It can help lower insulin and improve insulin resistance \n • It may decrease the risk of cancer \n • It’s anti-inflammatory and may help with arthritis \n • It can help increase endurance\n\nA compound called thromboxane can occur in your body after injury or inflammation and can lead to serious problems with the heart. However, a few things can inhibit this compound, including blood thinners, garlic, and olive oil.\n\nGarlic can help reduce the risk of clots. It also has natural properties that can potentially help lower blood pressure, reduce artery stiffness, and lower your calcium score. \n\nIt may also help balance lipids and cholesterol and help a person produce more bile, which then helps regulate cholesterol. It may even help with something called infective endocarditis because it’s very antimicrobial. \n\nGarlic water is one of the best things you can drink to help support a healthy heart, and it’s simple to make. All you need to do is crush one garlic clove and stir it into 8 to 12 ounces of water. Then, mix one teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil into the water, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and drink up. \n\nYou can also add more garlic to your recipes or take a supplement. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

There is a common disorder called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and that’s what we’re going to talk about today. \n\nThere is one key nutrient that is almost always missing in those who have a fatty liver, and that nutrient is choline. \n\nI’m convinced that if you don’t consume enough choline in your diet, you will develop a fatty liver. Choline is an essential nutrient. One of the main purposes of choline is to remove fat from the liver. \n\nCholine is also involved in your brain chemistry, muscle chemistry, and cell membranes. But unfortunately, a choline deficiency is pretty common. \n\nPotential causes of a fatty liver: \n • Alcohol \n • A high-carb diet \n • Corticosteroids \n • Tylenol \n • High blood pressure medications \n • Solvents \n • Petroleum products \n • Viruses \n • Insulin resistance (high insulin)\n • Low vitamin D, B12, or B3\n • Low folic acid \n • Seed oils\n • Fructose \n • High iron \n\nFour lesser-known potential causes of a fatty liver:\n1. Anorexia nervosa \n2. Gastric bypass\n3. Parenteral nutrition \n4. Antibiotics \n\nFoods high in choline:\n • Egg yolks\n • Liver \n • Beef \n • Chicken \n • Cruciferous vegetables \n • Salmon \n • Almonds \n\nYou may want to include more choline in your diet if you have fatty liver disease. If you take choline as a supplement, consider taking 3 grams per day to help speed up fat removal from your liver. \n\nIncluding choline as a part of your keto diet could be very beneficial.

Low animal product consumption is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. \n\nAnother cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is low hydrochloric acid (HCL) in your stomach. Your digestive system requires HCL to break down and absorb many vitamins and minerals. \n\nAs you age, your HCL level decreases. It can also decrease if you take antacids or Metformin. Interestingly, acid reflux can be a sign of low HCL, and taking antacids can make matters worse. \n\nBetaine hydrochloride is the best way to promote normal stomach acidity. \n\nYou may experience dementia-like symptoms due to the side effects of certain medications and substances, including:\n• Antacids\n• Bladder medications\n• Sleep aids\n• SSRIs\n• Cholesterol medications\n• Blood pressure medications\n• Steroids\n• Alcohol\n\nA deficiency in these nutrients can also produce dementia-like symptoms:\n• Vitamin B1 (often caused by high sugar and carb consumption) \n• Zinc (often a result of phytic acid in grains)\n• Vitamin D (caused by low sun exposure)\n\nNutrient deficiencies may shrink your hippocampus, which leads to Alzheimer’s disease. Increasing your ketones will help nourish a brain starved of fuel and nutrients.\n\nIf you’re experiencing dementia symptoms, try these things:\n1. Start Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting\n2. Consume more fatty fish and seafood\n3. Consume more red meat\n4. Take betaine hydrochloride\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

But, drinking too much water can actually dilute your electrolytes, worsening your skin. \n\nOther causes of dry skin:\n • Smoking \n • Sugar \n • Stress\n • Seed oils\n • Soap\n • Chlorine and fluoride from tap water \n • Petroleum or alcohol in makeup\n • Alcohol consumption\n\nIf nothing on the list seems to apply to you, you could be lacking essential fatty acids. A deficiency in essential fatty acids can cause dry and scaly skin. \n\nOmega-6 and omega-3 are essential fatty acids that your body can’t make—you must get them from your diet. But, chances are you’re getting enough omega-6 and not enough omega-3. \n\nYou can get omega-3 fatty acids from foods like sardines, fish, and cod liver oil. But, it’s also in other things like algae and seaweed, which are much better for a homemade face cream.  \n\nHere’s the best homemade face moisturizer recipe. \n\nIngredients:\n6 tsp water \n2 tsp chia seeds \n1 tsp seaweed powder or crushed seaweed sheets \n1 tsp extra virgin olive oil \n\nDirections: \nGrind the chia seeds and mix them into the water, then add the seaweed and olive oil. Mix the ingredients well. Apply the mixture to your face, wait for about 15 minutes, and then wash it off. \n\nThis DIY face moisturizer is just a quick fix. It’s crucial that you clean up your diet and include more omega-3 fatty acids in your diet to help correct your dry skin.

Yes! The healthy version of pizza I recommend is keto pizza—which means it’s low-carb. There are a lot of health benefits of going low-carb. \n\nBenefits of a low-carb diet:\n • Lowered insulin levels \n • Weight loss \n • Reduced fat on the liver \n • Cognitive support \n • Mood support \n • Healthy blood sugar levels \n • Fewer cravings \n\nThe most unhealthy part of a pizza is the crust. So, we’re going to make our healthy pizza with a cauliflower crust. \n\nCauliflower is a neutral-tasting food that can mimic starch. It’s a part of the cruciferous family, and it has a lot of healthy nutrients. It’s also low in carbs and sugar and high in fiber—making it the perfect ingredient for our healthy pizza crust.\n\nOne of the biggest things to remember when making this keto pizza is to bake the cauliflower crust before putting any toppings on it. After the crust is cooked, you can take it out, put the toppings on, and bake it again. \n\nHere’s how to make healthy pizza at home (for more instruction, watch the video and check out the link above).\n\nIngredients:\n • 2 cups organic shredded cauliflower \n • 2 organic pasture-raised eggs \n • 2 cups grated organic mozzarella cheese\n • Your choice of toppings \nOptional:\n • 1/2 tsp garlic \n • 1/2 tsp oregano \n • 1/2 tsp basil \n\nDirections: \nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit / 218 degrees Celsius. In a large bowl, mix the cauliflower, eggs, mozzarella, and spices of your choice. Form the crust on parchment paper and transfer it to the oven. \n\nAfter 10 to 15 minutes, or when the crust is light brown, remove it from the oven and let it cool. Add your toppings and bake the keto pizza again for 10 to 12 minutes. Enjoy!\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

If just one tooth is out of place when you bite down, it can affect your jaw and create a cascade of effects on the rest of your body. \n\nHowever, if you have pain on the right side of your jaw, there could potentially be an issue with your gallbladder. Basically, if the gallbladder is swollen, it can irritate a nerve in the diaphragm that goes right up your neck and may lead to pain in the right side of the jaw.\n\nThe best things to do for TMJ (check out the video for a full demonstration):\n1. Massage the muscles on the opposite side of your jaw from where you feel the most pain.\n\n2. Stretch and massage the buccinator and masseter muscles inside your mouth.\n\n3. Exercise the opposing jaw-closing muscles. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Walnuts contain something called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is a precursor for EPA and DHA, which are omega-3 fatty acids. \n\nAlpha-linolenic acid can potentially help prevent certain skin issues, such as:\n • Scaly skin \n • Dermatitis \n • Hyperpigmentation \n • Skin atrophy \n\nWhen ALA converts to EPA and DHA, it can help with various things, including supporting your heart and brain, decreasing inflammation, and the list goes on and on. There are some interesting studies that show benefits for your cardiovascular system. Studies also show a shift from small particle size LDL to large particle size LDL. \n\nWalnuts contain folate, polyphenols, and vitamin E. They are also low in lysine and high in arginine. \n\nArginine can potentially help:\n • Increase growth hormone \n • Rid excess ammonia \n • Increase nitric oxide and support cardiovascular health\n • Support healthy blood pressure \n\nThe problem is that raw walnuts contain phytates and enzyme inhibitors. Phytates block certain minerals, and consuming them too often can create a problem with mineral absorption and digestion. Enzyme inhibitors can lead to bloating and constipation. \n\nTo obtain the unique health benefits of walnuts and avoid the problems associated with them, you need to germinate the walnuts. \n\nTo germinate walnuts, all you have to do is soak them in water for 24 to 48 hours. This will remove the phytates and the enzyme inhibitors. After you soak them, you can dry them in an oven under low heat or in a dehydrator and enjoy!\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

But, if you never chew, you also don’t activate the muscles around your face to make the bones structurally sound. \n\nI believe the real cause behind breathing problems is that our mouths have become too small. If there isn’t enough space for our teeth to grow, they will be crooked. If the mouth is smaller, the airway passages will also be smaller, which will constrict a person’s breathing. \n\nIt’s crucial that kids stop consuming refined foods and start consuming foods that force them to chew more. But, as an adult, you can do things to make a change to your facial structure, which can lead to better breathing. \n\nWhat you can do:\n1. Breath through your nose \n2. Chew your food longer \n3. Consume fat-soluble vitamins \n4. Stop consuming processed foods \n5. Consume trace minerals \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Whether you have a lung infection, asthma, or COPD—this remedy could be very beneficial. \n\nA lung infection, asthma, and COPD have a few things in common. Each of these conditions involves inflammation, vasoconstriction, and immune issues. The problem with the typical treatment for lung conditions is that, over time, your body can become resistant to it. \n\nVitamin D is a potent remedy for many things, including inflammation in the lungs. But, there are mixed studies on the effectiveness of vitamin D for asthma and lung infections. \n\nA few general benefits of vitamin D:\n • It’s antimicrobial\n • It helps regulate the immune system\n • It’s anti-inflammatory \n • It supports the smooth muscle of your lungs to help you breathe better \n\nThere is a condition called polymorphism, where your vitamin D receptors don’t receive vitamin D as they should. If you’re not seeing the benefits you think you should expect from vitamin D, it may be because of this condition. \n\nIn this situation, increasing the amount of vitamin D you take may be beneficial. Infrared light therapy also has some interesting benefits for the lungs. \n\nPotential benefits of infrared light therapy:\n • It may help inhibit bronchoconstriction and help you breathe better\n • It’s a potent anti-inflammatory \n • It may help decrease fibrosis in COPD\n • It may help reduce pollution in the air\n\nThen, we have UV light. UV light can help kill germs and decrease pathogens in the air that could otherwise overload the immune system. \n\nThe best remedy to support and protect lung health is the sun. The sun gives you UV light, UVB light (which helps increase vitamin D), and infrared light. \n\nThe sun has a direct effect on your lungs, inflammation, and your immune system. It also helps stimulate melatonin, which acts as a powerful antioxidant and may help decrease coughing. \n\nYou can get all of these incredible benefits just by going outside and getting regular exposure to the sun but make sure you don't let yourself get burned.\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

The short answer is hydrogen peroxide. But, let's talk about why. \n\nHydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen. Our bodies actually make hydrogen peroxide as a defense mechanism to fight pathogens. \n\nHydrogen peroxide can kill microbes on vegetables. It can also help remove chemicals that kill microbes, like insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides. \n\nThe problem with these chemicals is that they are fat-soluble and can get locked into our fat cells, organs, and neurological tissue. \n\nSome form of insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, and pesticide has likely been used on your organic vegetables too. Even though it's not as toxic, it still might be on the vegetables you bring home. This is why a good nontoxic vegetable wash is essential. \n\nThere is hydrogen peroxide and food grade hydrogen peroxide. I recommend food grade hydrogen peroxide that's 3%. You need to dilute it by mixing 1/4 cup of food grade hydrogen peroxide in 1 gallon of water. You can then soak your vegetables in this mixture for about 20 minutes. Keep in mind that hydrogen peroxide only lasts about six months. \n\nDiluted hydrogen peroxide can also be used:\n • As a natural mouthwash\n • To help remove tartar  \n • As a natural deodorant \n • As a natural disinfectant \n • To help with an ear infection \n • To help with a sore throat \n • To help with acne \n • To help with athlete's foot\n\nNatural, nontoxic pesticide alternatives for your home and garden: \n • Neem oil \n • Diluted vinegar \n • Diluted castile soap \n • Diatomaceous earth \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

This isn’t meant to replace your medical care. Check with your doctor before implementing this information. \n\nThe typical treatments for bipolar disorder and OCD have a lot of potential side effects. But, these treatments work by manipulating neurotransmitters. \n\nWhat’s interesting is that the friendly microbes in your gut actually make neurotransmitters. If you have gut problems, your friendly microbes probably aren’t making enough neurotransmitters. People with bipolar disorder have a much higher incidence of gut inflammation. \n\nThe best natural protocol for bipolar disorder and OCD:\nFix any gut issues first:\n• Consume fermented foods with prebiotics and probiotics.\n\nGo on a low-carb ketogenic diet:\n• The carnivore version of keto may be beneficial for people with gut problems.\n\nTake fish oil:\n• I like cod liver oil because it contains vitamin D, vitamin A, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nTake B vitamins:\n• B1 and folate are very important. Nutritional yeast is a great source of natural B vitamins. \n\nCut out grains, sugar, and grain oils: \n• It’s essential to support the friendly microbes in the gut and remove things from the diet that cause inflammation. \n\nA few additional options:\n • Lithium orotate (for bipolar disorder) \n • N-acetly cysteine (for mania)\n • Hyperforin (for depression)\n • Glycine (for schizophrenia) \n • Niacin (for schizophrenia) \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

It’s a powder made up of fossilized diatoms. Diatoms are basically algae or phytoplankton. \n\nThe unique thing about diatomaceous earth is that it’s loaded with silicon. When silicon is exposed to oxygen, it becomes silica. \n\nSilica is really good for a person’s connective tissues, joints, and bones. Calcium can’t even help you form bone without silica. \n\nYou need enough silica to help support bone mineralization and prevent conditions like osteoporosis and osteopenia. \n\nSilica is also essential for your:\n • Ligaments\n • Tendons \n • Cartilage \n • Nails \n • Hair \n • Skin \n • Aorta \n • Trachea \n\nThere are different types of collagen. Silica also stimulates type 1 collagen. \n\nOther potential health benefits of diatomaceous earth:\n • It may help get rid of parasites, worms, pathogens, and even E. coli \n • It can bind with aluminum and help remove it from the body \n\nHow to use diatomaceous earth:\nDrink one teaspoon of diatomaceous earth mixed in a glass of water once per day. Over the next three days, you might want to increase it to two teaspoons per day. \n\nBe sure to take it on an empty stomach. To help improve absorption, you can also add apple cider vinegar to the water and diatomaceous earth mixture—or take a few betaine hydrochloride tablets when you take the mixture. \n\nIf you’re only trying to build up your connective tissue, you may want to take an orthosilicic acid supplement instead. But, if you want all of the above benefits, give diatomaceous earth a try. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

But, only 31% of chest pain cases have a connection to the heart. Even if it is related to the heart, it doesn’t mean it’s a heart attack. \n\nThere are a lot of different organs right under the chest cavity. A problem with one of these organs can often lead to chest pain. 42% of people with chest pain have a symptom related to their digestion—not the heart. \n\nIt’s good to ask yourself what happened just before you started experiencing chest pain. Maybe you ate something you shouldn’t have, or you’ve been under a lot of stress. This could help you narrow down the cause. \n\nChest pain causes that aren’t the heart: \n 1. GERD\n 2. The gallbladder/bile sludge \n 3. Costochondritis\n 4. Stress/panic attacks/broken heart syndrome \n 5. Pulmonary embolism \n 6. Pneumothorax \n 7. Aortic dissection \n 8. Pneumonia \n 9.

There is a huge push to get everyone to consume more grains. But, the problem is that we're already consuming too many grains. \n\nGrains have been made to seem very healthy, and we're told to consume grains as a foundation of our diet. But, grains can actually cause a lot of problems for your health. Today we're going to talk about just one of these major problems. \n\nGluten is the protein in a lot of grains. It's a term to describe various proteins within this category. One of these proteins can actually create an opioid effect. \n\nThere is a huge problem with opioid addiction around the world. One thing an opioid will do is increase endorphins. Endorphins help decrease pain and make us feel good.\n\nExorphins are endorphins that can be triggered by food. This stimulation of exorphins is why you like bread so much. But, this comes with other potential things like celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. \n\nCeliac disease is a severe reaction to gluten. The top symptoms of celiac disease can include:\n1. Diarrhea \n2. Bloating \n3. Abdominal pain \n\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity is basically celiac disease but without the classic symptoms. Symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity can include:\n • ADD \n • Depression \n • Anxiety \n • Autism \n • Schizophrenia \n • Inflammation \n • Atrophy \n • Permeability \n • Malabsorption \n • Deficiencies \n • Insomnia \n • Fatigue \n • Brain fog \n • Autoimmune conditions \n • Anemia\n • GERD \n • Headaches and migraines \n • Dermatitis \n • Psoriasis \n\nI want to challenge you to avoid eating bread and other grains for just one week. Then go back to eating bread and grains and compare how you feel to the previous week when you weren't consuming grains. Then decide whether or not it's worth giving up grains. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

There isn’t a lot of research on bone broth, but many people love it. If you have gut problems, arthritis, or an autoimmune disease, you might want to test it out to see how it works for you.\n\nBone broth is typically made from:\n • Bone\n • Joints\n • Connective tissue\n • Marrow \n • Ligaments \n • Tendons \n\nThe above are cooked down and made into broth. Cooking these things breaks them down into smaller amino acids, minerals, and fat-soluble vitamins. It also contains glutamine, which can help improve the gut barrier. \n\nAutoimmune diseases typically stem from a gut problem that leads to your immune system attacking itself. Arthritis is an autoimmune disease, so anything you can do to help heal your gut may be good for arthritis. \n\nThere are a few different causes of arthritis, so it’s important to target the root cause. Bone broth may not help for every type and cause of arthritis. \n\nAn interesting theory is that when you consume bone broth, the antibodies that are attacking your joints will be distracted and go after the decoy tissue in the broth. \n\nYou basically cause the autoimmune attack to occur in the stomach on this decoy tissue away from the inflamed joint. This gives the joint time to heal. \n\nIt’s believed that over time this could potentially deplete the store of antibodies in a person's system and improve autoimmune conditions. \n\nWhat to try for gut issues:\n • Consume fermented foods or take probiotics \n • Consume a diet higher in animal fat and animal protein\n • Cook or steam your vegetables \n • Avoid grains or grain oils\n • Avoid dairy \n • Consume eggs, organ meats, and bone marrow \n\nI don’t recommend bone broth during intermittent fasting. But, if you’re doing a prolonged fast, it might be helpful. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

If you’re on keto and your cholesterol has gone up, making you concerned—this video is for you. \n\nYour body makes cholesterol, and it also needs cholesterol. When you burn fat, part of that fat is cholesterol. When you lose weight, the cholesterol has to come out, temporarily increasing your cholesterol. \n\nIf you’re on a low-carb diet, you don’t really need to be concerned about your cholesterol. But, if you are concerned, you can get an advanced lipid profile test. Cholesterol also isn’t a good indicator of heart problems. A much better test is a CAC test. \n\nBile is an important fluid in the body that is essential in regulating cholesterol. Bile is made from cholesterol, and it helps you break down fats, extract fat-soluble vitamins, and prevent SIBO. \n\nYou also have secondary bile salts made by the friendly bacteria in your large intestine. A problem with your microbiome (friendly bacteria) can cause a lack of bile, which can lead to higher cholesterol. \n\nThere are some interesting studies that show that probiotics can help lower cholesterol. Studies also show that fiber helps reduce cholesterol. Fiber feeds your microbes that then make bile salts. The best source of healthy fiber is fermented vegetables. \n\nOne of the best remedies to lower cholesterol is niacin (vitamin B3). Niacin can help lower your cholesterol directly and indirectly by supporting bile production. \n\nIf a person has their gallbladder removed, they might not have enough primary bile salts to remove the cholesterol, and certain lipids can start increasing. \n\nOverall, the best natural remedies to lower cholesterol are:\n1. Probiotics (from food if possible) \n2. TUDCA \n3. Niacin \n\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

I used to have flat feet and was given arch supports, but they only made me dependent on the supports. I actually felt better when I stopped using them. \n\nShoes are also very unnatural. Compressing the toes into pointed shoes, for example, can create problems with your gait, balance, muscles, and knees.\n\nBecause you spend the majority of your day in shoes, it’s crucial to wear very comfortable shoes. \n\nShoes can increase your risk of:\n • Knee pain \n • Low back pain \n • Reduced range of motion\n • Increased temperature of the feet \n • Knee adduction \n • A stiff Achilles tendon \n • Reduced circulation \n • Shortened calf length \n\nStart looking for shoes that have less of a heel and are closer to the ground. They should also provide more space for your toes to help increase your stability. \n\nA fantastic therapeutic exercise for your feet is walking barefoot on grass and sand. At first, your feet will feel tired, but they will get stronger over time. \n\nBenefits of walking barefoot:\n1. A chance for your toes to spread \n2. More communication between your feet and the ground\n3. A decreased load on your joints\n4. An increased range of motion \n5.

I've talked about this before, but this is an updated video with a new stretch that I think is really going to help you.\n\nThe sciatic nerve is the longest and widest nerve in the body. Sciatica is pain that can come from your lower back and radiate down the legs. \n\nThe great majority of sciatic nerve pain involves a disc. An interesting thing about disc problems is that they typically come with a loss of the lumbar curve. \n\nIf you have sciatic pain, chances are you've lost the normal curve in your lower back. It's essential to do what you can to restore this curve. \n\nTo restore your lumbar curve, you can do a stretch that involves a firm foam support. When you lie on the foam support, you create constant stretching of ligaments, muscles, and tendons. \n\nThe first 10 to 15 minutes of using this device will give you relief but won't correct your curve. However, some interesting research shows that increasing the time you lie on the support to about 20 minutes every day could start to correct the curve. \n\nThis stretch may be uncomfortable at first, so work up to 20 minutes gradually. Start with 10 minutes every night and slowly get to where you can do 20 minutes comfortably. Even if your sciatic nerve pain goes away, continue to do this stretch to help correct the lumbar curve. \n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

There is an interesting cause of arthritis that not many people know about. This hidden cause of arthritis is iron overload. \n\nOur bodies don’t have a mechanism to get rid of excess iron, and too much iron in the body is toxic. One of the first symptoms of iron overload is arthritis in the hands and knees. \n\nOther symptoms of iron overload:\n • Fatigue \n • Abdominal pain \n • Bronze skin \n • Liver cirrhosis \n • Diabetes \n • Erectile dysfunction \n • Hypogonadism \n • Increased infection \n\nExcess iron is especially toxic to the liver, pancreas, and heart. The more the liver is damaged, the more problems you’ll have with iron. \n\nTop causes of iron overload:\n • Taking Tylenol \n • Consuming a high-carb diet\n • Consuming molasses \n • Taking multivitamins \n • Consuming too much red meat and not enough vegetables \n • Consuming red meat with sugar or starches \n\nUnderstanding what to do with your diet is crucial if you have iron overload. If you have this problem, you don’t want to start adding more iron to your diet. Fiber can help reduce iron overload. Consuming red meat with vegetables high in fiber may be beneficial. \n\nRemedies for iron overload:\n • Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate IP6) \n • Green tea\n • Cilantro \n • Quercetin \n\nDonating blood can be beneficial for iron overload. Doing what you can to improve your liver is also very important.

They may even drink it thinking they're getting some sort of benefit—but alcohol has zero health benefits. \n\nThere is a natural remedy that has virtually no side effects that can help reduce or prevent alcohol consumption. This remedy has been around since at least 600 AD, and it has been studied and shown significant results.\n\nThe effects of alcohol:\n • It depletes vitamin B1 \n • It increases the risk of cancer\n • It increases liver fat \n • It increases liver inflammation \n • It increases the risk of cirrhosis \n • It increases estrogen\n\nThe best natural remedy to help reduce alcohol consumption is called kudzu. You can consume this in a salad or take it as an extract. \n\nA placebo-controlled double-blind study done on mice showed that one dose (2 g) of kudzu significantly decreased the desire for alcohol within 2.5 hours. \n\nKudzu has very special phytonutrients that are involved in the breakdown of ethanol. It's very similar to certain medications used to help people curb their appetite for alcohol. \n\nYou can consume kudzu a couple of hours before an event where you might drink alcohol, and it can help reduce the desire for alcohol or the toxic effect of alcohol. \n\nKudzu also works on certain neurotransmitters in the brain directly involved in addiction. One study even suggests kudzu may help reduce cravings for cocaine. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Check this out! \n\n0:00 Introduction: Grain-fed vs. grass-fed beef\n0:45 Research on grass-finished vs. grain-finished beef\n3:19 Findings on grain-finished vs. grass-finished beef\n7:09 Key points \n9:05 Check out my video on the healthiest foods you can eat! \n\nThere is a fascinating research project in place right now on grain-finished vs. grass-finished beef. The project isn't done yet, but there is enough data to conclude that there is a major difference between these two types of beef. \n\nThe only reason someone would grain-finish an animal is because of cost—they can make more money off of it. But what about the nutrient density of grain-finished and grass-finished beef?\n\nFirst off, a scientist from this research project noted that the muscle meat from a grass-finished cow mimicked a healthy athlete. However, the grain-finished muscle mimicked a person with metabolic syndrome. \n\nGrain-finished beef has:\n • More inflammatory markers \n • Higher uric acid levels\n • Higher homocysteine levels\n • Higher advanced glycated end products \n • Higher amounts of niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3)\n\nGrass-finished beef has:\n • Higher omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA)\n • Higher amount of phytonutrients \n • Higher microbial diversity \n • Higher amounts of niacin (a form of vitamin B3)\n • Higher vitamin C levels \n • Higher vitamin E levels \n • Higher antitumor biomarkers \n • Higher choline\n • Higher carnosine \n\nHands down, not only were there more nutrients in the grass-fed, grass-finished beef, there were better metabolic biomarkers—which measure the overall health of the muscle.  \n\nAfter this research is done, they need to do the next level of the study, which is to determine if consuming a healthier animal product makes a difference on a person's health. \n\nKeep in mind that something is better than nothing. If you can't do grass-fed, grass-finished beef, it's still good to get on the keto diet. \n\nThe most important thing is to keep your carbs low. Do what you can, and don't worry about the quality at first. The benefits of doing a low-carb diet are huge. \n\nIf you can, the next phase to work up to would be increasing the quality of the foods you eat until you get to the point where you're doing the healthy version of the ketogenic diet. \n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

These mood changes can also cause an increased risk of periodontal infections and disease. \n\nOn the flip side, when a person takes an antibiotic or antifungal and wipes out their microbial population, it can dramatically affect their mood and breath. Psychosis, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks are all potential side effects of antibiotics. \n\nThere is a spike in cortisol when a person experiences stress and anxiety. Cortisol suppresses the diversity of microbes you have and paralyzes your immune system. Chronic elevation of cortisol destroys your microbes and affects your breath. \n\nYour body has a complex group of friendly bacteria, yeast, and fungus that all work together. You need the right ratios of them to maintain a healthy body. Sauerkraut and kefir are fantastic foods you can consume to help promote a healthy ratio of bacteria, yeast, and fungus.\n\nOverall, your mood can affect your microbes, and your microbes can affect your mood. The quality of your breath is directly related to the balance of your microbes. \n\nWhat to try for anxiety and depression:\n • Take vitamin D (for depression)\n • Take vitamin B1 (for anxiety) \n • Get outdoors \n • Exercise \n • Do physical work outdoors \n • Try indoor rock climbing \n • Change your diet (get on the Healthy Keto diet) \n • Do intermittent fasting \n\nADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:\nhttps://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\n\nFREE COURSE➜ ➜ http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

It’s essential that your iron levels are balanced because both an iron deficiency and excess iron can be devastating. \n\nAn iron deficiency is a very common problem. People diagnosed with a deficiency of iron are told to take elemental iron—which is not the best form of iron for absorption. \n\nTaking elemental iron can cause symptoms of an iron deficiency to last, and it won’t take care of the root problem. \n\nIt’s best to get your iron from your diet instead of a supplement. If you have to take a supplement, make sure it contains dehydrated beef liver or spleen extract. \n\nAn iron deficiency can affect your skin and lead to sallow skin, which can cause:\n • Paleness\n • Yellowing \n • Dullness\n • An uneven skin tone \n • Blemishes \n\nAn iron deficiency can affect your nails, causing: \n • Brittleness\n • Spooning \n\nAn iron deficiency can affect your hair, causing: \n • A loss of texture \n • Brittleness\n • Toughness \n • Pattern hair loss \n • Thinning \n\nTop causes of an iron deficiency:\n • Not consuming enough iron \n • A lack of hydrochloric acid \n • Gut inflammation\n • Consuming foods high in phytic acid \n • Consuming too much bran \n • Consuming too much copper\n • Lead present in your body \n • Blood loss\n • Gastric bypass surgery \n • Alcohol consumption \n\nHow to boost iron:\n1. Consume red meat \n2. Take betaine hydrochloride (5 to 7 before a meal)\n3. Stop eating foods that block iron\n4.

The key to reestablishing your energy is to address the root causes of fatigue and the nutritional deficiencies behind fatigue. \n\nThere are two top causes of fatigue. The first is a lack of sleep. It doesn't matter how many supplements you take—you're still going to be tired if you're not sleeping. \n\nThe second core cause of fatigue is running your body on the wrong fuel (glucose). Burning fat is the most efficient source of energy. To do that, you need to get on the Healthy Keto diet. \n\nOverall, to boost your energy and avoid fatigue, you need to consume a variety of healthy foods and avoid foods that cause fatigue, like sugar and refined carbs. You also need to make sure you're getting plenty of quality sleep. \n\nPrimary nutrient deficiencies that cause fatigue:\n1. Vitamin B12 \nThe best source:\n• Animal products \n\n2. Folate (B9)\nThe best source:\n• Dark leafy greens \n\n3. Iron \nThe best source:\n• Red meat \n\n4.

Urine that’s retained can back up in your system and potentially lead to a lot of complications. \n\nThese complications can include:\n • Edema \n • A loss of protein in your urine\n • A build-up of ammonia (strong ammonia-smelling urine)\n • Sugar in your urine \n • Loss of muscle \n • Fatigue \n • Itchiness \n • Brain fog \n\nDiabetes is a big cause of urinary retention. High levels of sugar damage the capillaries of the kidneys and can lead to permanent damage. On top of that, a person with diabetes typically consumes a high-carb diet, which can cause fluid retention. \n\nCommon causes of urinary retention:\n • Diabetes \n • A high-carb diet \n • Age \n • An enlarged prostate \n • Fibroids \n • Excess sodium consumption with low potassium consumption \n • A problem with the autonomic nervous system \n • Pregnancy \n • Kidney stones \n • Bladder stones \n • Certain medications \n\nWhat to do for urinary retention:\n1. Cut out carbs and sugar \n2. Increase your fluids (3 liters in the first part of the day) \n3. Consume herbal diuretic alternatives (dandelion greens and watercress)\n4. Consume more potassium foods or an electrolyte powder (at least seven cups of vegetables per day)\n5. Consume a moderate amount of protein (3-6 oz per meal)\n\nDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:\nDr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

She selfishly refuses to share even a single coin with Wendy and later snubs a modest dress in favor of a golden one. Charlotte's opulence extends to school, where she flaunts her golden possessions, only to find they're impractical for learning.\n\nIn contrast, Maddie's simple lifestyle shines through. She generously feeds her hungry dog and creatively fixes her jacket with patches, showing resourcefulness. In school, Charlotte struggles with her fancy gadgets, and Maddie comes to her rescue, offering practical school supplies. Touched by Maddie's kindness, Charlotte realizes the joy in sharing and being helpful.\n\nBack home, Charlotte surprises Wendy with a gift and a nice meal, embracing the spirit of giving. The episode ends with Charlotte experiencing the joy of doing things for others, a lesson she's grateful to have learned.\n\nLesson Learned: The story teaches the value of simplicity, kindness, and the joy of sharing with others, contrasting it with the hollow satisfaction of material wealth.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdKicyl_ve5oyjasiO6njgQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch more of our latest videos on our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fda3dtoaaac&index=3&list=PLyA9jdfCjx0MMBrLKK8xo0iD3GdK24CqS\n\n#ToysPlay #PretendPlay #ToysandColors",

                "description": "Maddie plays hide and seek slips through three colorful doors in her living room, leaving Ellie in delightful confusion. Maddie's giggles hint at her hidden presence, but Ellie just can't catch up. So, Ellie seeks the help of Officer Jim, who turns Ellie into a mini-officer! Together, they chase Maddie from a fun-filled ball pit, through a mysterious jungle with \"walking\" trees, to an intricate Lego maze. Just when they think they've caught Maddie, they're fooled by a doppelgänger doll! In the end, the chase leads everyone to a splashy finish at the pool with Auntie Beth and others, where water gun battles ensue, and everyone joyfully waves goodbye.\n\nLesson Learned:\nAlways approach challenges with a sense of fun and curiosity. Sometimes, the journey is more important than the destination.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdKicyl_ve5oyjasiO6njgQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch more of our latest videos on our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fda3dtoaaac&index=3&list=PLyA9jdfCjx0MMBrLKK8xo0iD3GdK24CqS\n\n#ToysPlay #PretendPlay #ToysandColors",

Enrollment is open now until December 27.  the class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience, designed to teach you everything I know about filmmaking and storytelling, i'm going to share with you my entire creative process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I create 2 brand new movies from scratch... from how I come up the ideas, all the way through exporting the final videos.\n\nover the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 2 original, shareable films of your own.  its is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. I spent the past year working on it, and I'm extremely proud of the result. It's designed to level you up whether you're a beginner or a more experienced filmmaker.\n\nThe class officially starts on January 10, 2022, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested\n\n(also In the video, I say it's $300, but it's actually $249)\n\nMUSIC IN THIS VIDEO FROM; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcRgUmODSC8",

Justin’s multifaceted identity as a songwriter, artist, and advocate helped shape the way we built the tool, not only to make it more effective for artists, but also making sure that we were taking creatives’ apprehension about working with AI into account. \n\nAfter months of collaborating with Google to refine and shape Music AI Sandbox, Justin integrated it into their workflow for a studio session with longtime collaborators. The result was a glimpse into the future of music making and creativity. Learning and working with Justin was an absolute joy, and we’re looking forward to shaping the future of music and creativity alongside some of its strongest advocates. #AI #Music #JustinTranter\n\nSubscribe to our Channel: https://www.youtube.com/google\nFind us on X: https://twitter.com/google\nWatch us on TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@google\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/google\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Google",

On this episode of Founded, they share their experience managing and growing a technical team. Learn how leadership and communication styles evolve with a growing startup, when to begin hiring, how to motivate employees through difficult times, what’s involved in training new team members, and more.\n\nAbout the Founders:\n\nSasha Haco is the CEO and founder of Unitary, which aims to make the internet safer by automatically detecting harmful online content. Unitary's state-of-the-art AI models interpret content in context, automating the content moderation process by developing an understanding of the meaning behind user-generated interactions. Before founding Unitary in 2019, Sasha was studying mathematics to solve the mysteries of the universe at the University of Cambridge and as a visiting fellow at Harvard University. During her PhD, she worked with Stephen Hawking to explore the ‘information paradox’ to answer the question: what happens to objects when they fall into a black hole? Her research, which aimed to derive the entropy of black holes, was documented in the Netflix film The Edge of All We Know. Driven by understanding–and solving–complex problems, Sasha joined Entrepreneur First in 2019 where she met co-founder James Thewlis and founded Unitary in June of that year.\n\nKasia Dorsey, who was nominated as Forbes “100 European Female Founders'', after spending years in marketing within The Coca-Cola Co., has founded Yosh.AI with a mission to re-invent communication between companies and end users with conversational AI, focusing on voice AI agents for call centers. The products include AI voice and text virtual assistants, visual search across numerous communication channels and over 100 languages. Yosh.AI currently works successfully with many international companies focusing on EMEA and NorthAm, in retail, banking and insurance, helping them implement automation into their communication streams through the use of AI. Yosh.AI is a global Google Cloud Partner and the winner of numerous International technology competitions including prestigious winner award from The AI Journal, “Global Excellence Awards” for “Best Use of AI for Customer Experience” in 2021. Forbes named Yosh.AI as a company that is changing the future of retail. Kasia is passionate about deep-tech and adding value to the business through the further implementation of AI. She is an active mentor at Google and is the global Ambassador of the Blackbox Silicon Valley Acceleration program. She supports the growth of innovative solutions and passionate people.\n\n#Founded  #WomenTechmakers #Accelerator #startups #entrepreneurship #womenintech #acceleratedwithgoogle \n\n\n\nSubscribe to our Channel: https://www.youtube.com/google\r\nTweet with us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/google\r\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/google\r\nJoin us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Google\nSee more episodes of Founded → https://goo.gle/2H37XjR \nSubscribe to Women Techmakers → https://goo.gle/WomenTech",

This was achieved through creating light hearted animated content featuring a white marshmallow looking mascot with the iconic two-leaves on its head. The leaves symbolizing ever lasting growth. When water properly, it will sprout to be very green and big. \n\nFast forward to 2024, post covid, psych2go has built a wonderful community of young and mature people who are passionate about taking care of their mental health while learning more about how to help those around them as well. We are so proud of this amazing community that otherwise would not have existed should the decision to start a Youtube channel not happen. \n\nStaying true to our grass root approach of involving community members, fans and friends, we hope to collectively move the world into an elevated state of mental wellbeing. \n"

                "description": "We previously made a video on \"The Rise of Female Loneliness.\" There were a lot of heartfelt responses that we are shedding light on a topic that's less talked about and sometimes stereotype. There were requests for us to cover \"The Rise of Male Loneliness.\" As promise, here it is. \n\nMale loneliness has become a significant issue, often referred to as the \"male loneliness epidemic,\" and its impact on mental health cannot be understated. Many lonely men struggle in silence, feeling as though no one cares, which can contribute to male depression and further isolation. This loneliness epidemic is particularly harmful, as societal norms often discourage men from seeking help or expressing emotions. For a lonely man wondering, “I’m so lonely, how do I stop feeling this way?” addressing the issue starts with acknowledging the problem and seeking ways to connect with others. Learning how to deal with loneliness might involve joining social groups, seeking therapy, or exploring hobbies that encourage interaction. Understanding how loneliness impacts men is essential to breaking the cycle, as tackling male loneliness requires dismantling stigmas around vulnerability and creating spaces where lonely men feel supported.\n\n#maleloneliness #loneliness #mentalhealth \n\nWriter: Dylan Swanepoel\nScript Editor & Manager: Kelly Soong \nVoice Over: Gabriel Miles\nAnimator: Evelvaii\nYouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong\n\nDisclaimer: This is not to say that only men experience loneliness and that women do not, nor to say one’s experience is worse than the other. The truth is, both men and women can struggle with loneliness, but the reasons and ways they experience it can vary. This video focuses on male loneliness, and we will cover female loneliness in another video. Also, the views expressed here are based on personal opinions and experiences and may not reflect everyone’s perspective.

                "description": "In our previous video, we made a video about what happens when a dark empath MEETS a narcissist and many of you liked the video. So today, we'll be going deeper. What happens when a dark empath DATES a narcissist?  In this video, we look into the often tumultuous dynamics of a romantic relationship between a dark empath and a narcissist.\n\nWhat is a Dark Empath? \nA dark empath is someone who possesses a high level of emotional insight and empathy but may use this understanding in manipulative or self-serving ways.\n\nWhat is a Narcissist? \nA narcissist is an individual who exhibits excessive self-importance, a lack of empathy, and a need for admiration, often at the expense of others.\n\nWe’ll explore how these two types interact, the unique challenges they might face, and the overall impact on their relationship. Whether you're in this type of relationship or just interested in understanding these dynamics better, we'll share insights on how a dark empath's emotional depth and a narcissist's need for validation play out together, creating a dysfunctional relationship. \n\nDisclaimer: This video is for informational purposes only and is not intended to diagnose or demonize anyone. The aim is to provide insights into the dynamics between a dark empath and a narcissist, not to label, excuse, or judge individuals. If you have concerns about your own relationships or mental health, please seek guidance from a qualified professional.\n\nWriter: Brandi Michele Ortiz\nEditor: Morgan Swift\nScript Manager: Kelly Soong\nVoice Over: Gabriel Miles\nAnimator: Danica Diamos\nYoutube Manager: Cindy Cheong\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nCuncic, A.

                "description": "Are you trying to be \"low maintenance\" in relationships, friendships, the workplace, or life in general, thinking it makes you more likable or easygoing? This video explores why striving to be low maintenance can be harmful and delves into the concept of hyper-independence or fawning —a common trauma response.\n\nWe’ll talk about how people-pleasing behaviors, hyper-independence, and fawn trauma responses can affect your mental health and relationships. We'll also explore how childhood trauma and the tendency to become hyper-independent might be ways you’re trying to cope with past experiences. We’ll touch on the \"cool girl\" and \"cool guy\" mentality and how it connects to these trauma responses. Our goal is to help you understand these patterns and find supportive ways to address them.\n\nDiscover why it’s so important to recognize these patterns and understand fawning, and hyper-independence, especially if you’ve been struggling with trauma. We hope this video helps you address these challenges and start healing, guiding you towards a healthier and more authentic self.\n\n#trauma #mentalhealth \n\nDisclaimer: While this video uses examples like \"pick-me girl\" and \"cool girl,\" these terms are chosen to reflect current societal standards and perceptions.

Learn how to overcome your fear by analyzing the roots of your anxiety, practicing self-compassion, and seeking help from a mental health professional if needed. Discover the reasons behind your fear and realize it's not your fault by exploring past traumatic experiences. Research shows that self-compassion can weaken the fear of intimacy by allowing you to give love to yourself, making it easier to let others love you as well. Remember, there is no shame in seeking help from a mental health professional to overcome this fear in a safe and comforting setting.\n\n#shorts \n\nWriter: Stela Košić\nScript Manager: Kelly Soong\nVoice: Amanda Silvera (www.youtube.com/amandasilvera)\nAnimator: Zuzia \nYouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong\n\nReferences:\n\nChoosingTherapy.com.

                "description": "Do you constantly push people away, react sensitively to situations, or resort to bad habits like drinking, smoking, or reckless behaviors? They could be signs of unresolved trauma. Trauma occurs when negative past events leave people with emotional or physical scars. It is important to seek your own path of healing, but do you blame yourself for being a bad person for doing these things? If so, maybe it's time to stop self-victimizing and focus more on things that you can do to improve yourself as a person. You are not a bad person, and you are not your trauma. \n\nWriter: Chloe Avenasa  \nScript Editor: Vanessa Tao \nScript Manager: Kelly Soong \nVoice: Amanda Silvera (https://www.youtube.com/amandasilvera) \nAnimator: Krisha Que (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBDeFiZRypELJVvWgK3Orfw)\nYouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong     \n\nReferences:\n\nAmerican Psychological Association (2013).

But psychology actually says that there are two “faces” to narcissism: one grandiose and exhibitionist (called “overt narcissism”) and another vulnerable and sensitive (known as covert narcissism”). \n\nAt first glance, you probably wouldn’t even realize someone is a covert narcissist because of how much more reserved in nature they seem to be than their overt counterparts. But make no mistake, a covert narcissist is still a narcissist, and they can be every bit as manipulative, exploitative, ruthless, and inconsiderate.

Trauma bonding refers to the deep emotional attachment one might feel towards their abuser, and it’s more likely to develop in those who have a history of abuse, exploitation, or emotional codependency in their past relationships. Regardless of whether the relationship is romantic, platonic, or familial in nature, trauma bonds can easily be mistaken for feelings of love and commitment towards another person. So we made this video to help you understand the difference of trauma bonding and true love. \n\nIf you related to this video and want to learn more about narcissism in relationships, we have a video on the signs you may be dating a narcissist: https://youtu.be/VbO-cXBImtM\n\nWriter: Chloe Avenasa \nScript Editor: Vanessa Tao \nScript Manager: Kelly Soong \nVoice: Amanda Silvera (www.youtube.com/amandasilvera)  \nAnimator: Hannah Roldan \nYouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong     \n\nReferences: \nHadeed, L.

One aspect of clinical depression is rumination or negative thoughts. This happens when we go into a spiral of talking negatively about ourselves. For example, \"No body cares about me,\" I'm a burden,\" \"I have no purpose in this world\" are examples. The list goes on. If you're guilty of this, then we suggest watching this video to help spread awareness of how depression can actually be tricking us into thinking worse of ourselves than we really are. \n\nMay is Mental Health Awareness month and as it is coming to an end, we hope to keep spreading awareness about the impact of certain mental health conditions on our wellbeing.

Difficulties like trusting others, low self-esteem, fears of being judged, constant nightmares, or self-destructive behaviours can be hidden signs that someone may have experienced trauma of some sort. Adults can develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder even if they have no explicit memory of an early childhood trauma, according to research by UCLA psychologists.\n\nAlthough you may recognize some of these signs in yourself or someone you know, it is BEST not to diagnose yourself.

In a world where we are more connected than ever, why is the suicide rate increasing, and mental health declining? One of the reason is because we are less willing to talk to people face to face. Without that face to face connection, we don't truly get the endorphins we need to feel good.

But if you understand what polls are actually capable of telling you, it might dispel any desire you have for them to predict whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will be the next president. \n\nWe interviewed pollsters about their processes and explained the basics of how they turn small surveys into a way to measure the entirety of a voting population. No matter what measures pollsters take to make their samples as representative as possible, there’s a limit to how precise they can be.

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nA key promise in Paris’s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was that its famous river, the Seine, would be cleaned up in time to host open water swimming events: the triathlon, para triathlon, and marathon swimming. But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain, when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. \n\nWhen that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike in the river, making it too contaminated to swim in. In order to make good on its promise to clean the river, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that includes a massive underground tank and tunnel system meant to hold excess sewage during heavy rain and prevent further contamination of the Seine. \n\nWater quality testing will be done daily ahead of the Olympic games this summer, and Paris officials are hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed. \n\nFollow the daily water quality tests of the Seine from the City of Paris here: \nhttps://www.paris.fr/pages/meteo-de-la-seine-quelle-est-la-qualite-de-l-eau-du-fleuve-27467\n\nCheck out some of the data used in this video, along with additional water quality tests, from Fluidion:\nhttps://fluidion.com/open-data-initiative/2024-seine-water-quality\n\nAre Olympians Going to Swim in Poop Water? – The Cut\nhttps://www.thecut.com/article/olympics-2024-athletes-swim-unsanitary-seine-river.html\n\nWill the Seine be ready for Olympic swimming?

In 2024, even though inflation rates have fallen to more manageable levels, prices are still way up and are very unlikely to come down. Which, understandably, continues to be a source of major stress for people all over the world. So why can’t prices just stay the same?\n\nAs a consumer, steady prices and zero inflation seems like the ideal: You want your purchasing power to stay the same and for your dollar today to buy you exactly the same amount as your dollar tomorrow. But even in times of global economic health and stability, governments and their central banks actively avoid letting inflation get too low. That’s because 0 percent inflation might actually end up doing more harm than good.\n\nIn this video, we take a look at the reasons why.\n\nSources and further reading:\nTo take a closer look at inflation and interest rates in the US, check out FRED (the Federal Reserve’s economic data repository): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ \n\nYou can read more about inflation targets here: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/pdf/jahpan-inflation-targeting.pdf  \n\nAnd you can see more of Rakeen’s work here: https://groundworkcollaborative.org/person/rakeen-mabud/ \n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Activists and even just large swaths of the general public have been raising the alarm about this for well over a decade, but it hasn’t stopped the rise of some of the worst offenders in the industry. For example, the ultra-fast fashion brand Shein has skyrocketed in value over the past five years largely due to their marketing success on TikTok. A lot of us know that fast fashion is bad, but the only way companies like Shein still thrive is if we convince ourselves otherwise and hit “add to cart” anyway. So why do we do it? \n\nThe answer is that e-commerce has completely warped our view of what items should cost and how long they should last (this includes and extends to our obsession with Amazon and two-day shipping). We’re moving through trends at an unprecedented pace and it’s doomed to get worse if we don’t adjust our buying habits and learn to slow down. Consumers are being manipulated, but we can do better. \n\nWatch the video above to learn more, and don’t forget to check out the Vox article by Izzie Ramirez: https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations\n\nYou can also watch the sister video to this one from last year on why everything is worse now: \nhttps://youtu.be/DHXBacEH0qo?si=wft1yGpeqbdcv1Vq\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nRelated Vox articles:\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/3/21080364/fast-fashion-h-and-m-zara\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/7/19/22535050/gen-z-relationship-fast-fashion\nhttps://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology\nhttps://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost\nhttps://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/27/21080107/fashion-environment-facts-statistics-impact\n\nFashion transparency index: https://www.fashionrevolution.org/about/transparency/\nThe state of fashion: https://cdn.businessoffashion.com/reports/The_State_of_Fashion_2024.pdf\nMore on the psychology of fast fashion: https://www.thesustainablefashionforum.com/pages/the-psychology-of-fast-fashion-exploring-the-complex-emotions-fast-fashion-evokes-in-consumers\n\nMore on the environmental toll:\nhttps://earth.org/fast-fashions-detrimental-effect-on-the-environment/\nhttps://psci.princeton.edu/tips/2020/7/20/the-impact-of-fast-fashion-on-the-environment\nhttps://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/environmental-costs-fast-fashion\nhttps://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/sustainability/fast_fashion\n\nYou can find Cora’s book and blog here: https://www.thelingerieaddict.com/in-intimate-detail\n\nVideo tags: \nFast fashion, fashion, waste, environment, shein, temu, h&m, zara, asos, tiktok, trends, trend cycles, consumers, consumerism, buying, clothing, pollution, runway, labor practices, unethical, hauls, shein haul, gen z, human rights, consumer goods, quality, brands, transparency, misinformation, uniqlo, trendy, cheap, inexpensive, true cost, cost, price, social media, e-commerce, greenwashing, even better, advice, service",

Streaming is more expensive than ever, and prices just keep going up. Password sharing has been cracked down on, forcing more of us to pay to stream. And in the backdrop of all that, advertising is back with a vengeance, thanks to the rise of the cheaper ad-supported subscription tiers.\n\nAs a consumer, this feels infuriating. But we’re not entirely at the whim of these companies. So why is all this happening? And what can we do to not go broke while still enjoying our favorite shows?\n\nNote: The title on this video has been changed.\nPrevious title: Streaming got expensive.

                "description": "We don’t like the two-party system. So why do we have it?\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nAmerica’s two-party system is widely hated. Very few Americans think the two major parties do an adequate job representing us, and most say more parties are needed. But when it comes time to vote, very few of us actually vote for third-party candidates. Often, this is explained as either a failure of will (we’d have third parties if more people would just vote for them), or a conspiracy (the political and media establishments suppress third-party candidates and ideas).\n\nAnd it’s not that those things aren’t true. But there’s a much simpler explanation, and it’s the very basic rule governing almost every single one of our elections: Only one person can win. If you’re American, that probably sounds utterly reasonable: what the hell other kinds of elections even are there? But the answer is: lots. Winner-take-all elections (also called plurality voting, or “first past the post”) are actually a practice that most advanced democracies left behind long ago — and they’re what keep us from having more political options.\n\nEven if you’re not sold on the need for more parties in the US, though, scratch the surface of “only one person can win” a little and you start to see how it actually produces perverse results within the two-party system as well. It’s a big part of why the political parties have moved farther apart from each other, and it leaves about half of the country without any political representation at all.

In exchange for their release, the Israeli government has  a bargaining chip that is extremely valuable to Palestinians: the thousands of Palestinian prisoners locked up in Israeli prisons. \n\nEach one of these Palestinian prisoners has been processed by Israel’s military court system, which exists completely separate from the civilian court system that Jewish Israelis interact with. This system and the military orders that govern it have their origins in the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967.\n\nIn this video, two experts explain Israel’s military court system, why it’s been a focus of outcry from human rights organizations and why hostage negotiations have historically involved the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. \n\nVox policy correspondent Abdallah Fayyad wrote about Israel’s military court system for Vox’s site: \nhttps://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/22/23972908/palestinian-prisoners-israel-administrative-detention\n\nFor statistics on Palestinian prisoners, we relied on the work of Israeli human rights organization Addameer: \nhttps://www.addameer.org/statistics\n\nWe relied on B’Tselem as a source and some of the footage you see in the video: \nhttps://www.btselem.org/militarycourts\n\nFor a list of our other sources: \nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/19/separate-and-unequal/israels-discriminatory-treatment-palestinians-occupied\n\nhttps://www.btselem.org/download/19670827_order_regarding_prohibition_of_incitement_and_hostile_propaganda.pdf\n\nhttps://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/Public/files/English/Publications/Review/5/Adalahs-Review-5-65-Baker-Definition-Security-Prisoners.pdf\n\nhttps://www.btselem.org/statistics/detainees_and_prisoners\n\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/5141/2022/en/\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/i/israel/israel946.pdf\n\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/briefing_note/join/2013/491484/EXPO-AFET_SP%282013%29491484_EN.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/unchilded-birth-un-expert-calls-decisive-protection-palestinian-children\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

We set out to learn how it got there.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRight in the center of the island nation of Madagascar there’s a strange, almost perfectly circular geological structure. It covers a bigger area than the city of Paris — and at first glance, it looks completely empty. But right in the center of that structure, there’s a single, isolated village: a few dozen houses, some fields of crops, and dirt roads stretching out in every direction. \n\nWhen we first saw this village on Google Earth, its extreme remoteness fascinated us. Was the village full of people? How did they wind up there? And what did life look like in such a strange geography? To find out, we teamed up with a local team in Madagascar and fell down a rabbit hole of geology and mapping along the way. It’s a story of how continental shifts and volcanic geology came together to form a place for a group of people to call home. \n\nCheck out an extended look at the interviews in this video: https://youtu.be/YIOon-drZhE\n\nWe got to talk with a lot of experts along the way to make this piece. Here are links to some of their work:\n\nHere is some of Michel Jébrak’s research on the Richat structure: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32048440_Resolving_the_Richat_enigma_Doming_and_hydrothermal_karstification_above_an_alkaline_complex\n\nHere is Ndivhuwo Cecilia Mukosi’s original paper on the Ambohiby Complex: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318723814_Petrogenesis_of_the_Ambohiby_Complex_Madagascar_and_the_role_of_the_Marion_Hotspot_plume\n\nWe also spoke with Stian Rice, author of Famine in the Remaking, who helped us understand more about the history of agriculture in Madagascar:  https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2022/01/24/madagascars-famine-is-more-than-climate-change/\n\nCheck out Stian’s book on famine and food systems: https://wvupressonline.com/node/831\n\nNorman Thomas Uphoff at Cornell’s SRI International Network also shared more about agricultural systems and innovation: http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/\n\nCorrection: At 2:52, we mistakenly labeled Lucienne Wilmé as a professor of geology at the University of Florida.

Films like Creed, John Wick, and Bullet Train have scenes that make you feel every punch.\n\nBut not all fight scenes are created equal. We’ve all seen scenes that rely on quick cuts to conceal the absence of actual physical contact, or scenes that just don’t land. Crafting a fight that immerses the audience and makes them feel like they’re in the midst of the action requires a delicate dance between choreography, the work of stunt performers, strategic camera angles, immersive sound effects, and, above all, a compelling story.\n\nMost of the time, actors and stuntmen aren’t really hitting each other. So how do they make it feel realistic? In Vox’s latest, stunt coordinator and second unit director Wade Eastwood breaks down the artistry behind creating on-screen battles that leave a lasting impact on viewers, even when the punches aren’t real.\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: How to fake a punch like movie stars\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

The Nakba isn’t the beginning of the story, but it’s a key part of Palestinian history — and the root of Israel’s creation. \n\nPrior to the Nakba, Palestine had a thriving population — largely made up of Arabs — that had lived and worked the land for centuries. But with the founding of Zionism, years of British meddling, and a British pledge to help create a Jewish state in Palestine — things began to change drastically. By 1947, with increasing tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinian Arabs — the British left Palestine, and the UN stepped in with a plan to partition the land into two states. What followed was known as Plan Dalet: operations by Israeli paramilitary groups that violently uprooted Palestinians. An estimated 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were decimated, and roughly 750,000 Palestinians displaced. \n\nMost who were expelled from their homes couldn’t return to historic Palestine. And today, millions of their descendants live in refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank and surrounding countries. The history of the Nakba has been deliberately concealed and often ignored in western narratives around the creation of Israel. In this episode of Missing Chapter, we break down how the Nakba happened — and how it defined the future of Palestine. \n\nSources:\n\nCheck out the documentary “1948: Creation & Catastrophe” by Ahlam Muhtaseb and Andy Trimlett for more information about the events around the Nakba - https://tubitv.com/movies/513674/1948-creation-catastrophe \n\nAll That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948 was a great resource in helping us understand the Nakba - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22236243-all-that-remains\n\nFor our maps, we relied heavily on these organizations: Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, Institute for Middle Eastern Understanding, Palestine Remembered and Zochrot\n\nhttp://www.passia.org/maps/view/2 \nhttps://imeu.org/topic/category/maps \nhttps://www.palestineremembered.com/Maps/index.html \nhttps://www.zochrot.org/ \n\nThis report by Ilan Pappe helped us understand how Zionist forces planned to destroy villages - \nhttps://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/1650358 \n\nFor our population breakdowns, we mainly used Australian National University’s Palestine Census reports archive - \nhttps://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/yabber_census.html \n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

While AI art may appear to involve just a few clicks, it can be quite time-consuming.\n\nThe video above demonstrates the abridged workflow of the anonymous creator behind \"Stelfie\" — a time-traveling selfie-taker. The artist's process involves custom 3D-generated heads, initial sketches, and extensive toggling between Photoshop and the AI program Stable Diffusion to achieve the ideal appearance.\n\nThroughout this process, the artist employs typical AI art tools such as inpainting (modifying specific image areas), outpainting (extending beyond the frame), and denoising (controlling image alterations). AI art can be as labor-intensive as traditional art, but its distinct outcomes make the final product unique.\n\nCheck out more of Stelfie here: \nhttps://www.stelfiett.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stelfiett/\nhttps://twitter.com/StelfieTT\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@stelfiett?lang=en\n\nWant to learn more?

But there’s an often overlooked bias toward languages that are already well-represented on the internet. That means some languages might lose out in AI’s big technical advances.\n\nSome researchers are looking into how that works — and how to possibly shift the balance from these “high resource” languages to ones that haven’t yet had a huge online footprint. These approaches range from original dataset creation, to studying the outputs of large language models, to training open source alternatives.\n\nWatch the video above to learn more.\n\nFurther reading:\nhttps://ruth-ann.notion.site/ruth-ann/JamPatoisNLI-A-Jamaican-Patois-Natural-Language-Inference-Dataset-91523ec89af24bfdbcb9c1ec7e28cc3c\n\nThis is the hub for Ruth-Ann Armstrong’s JamPatois NLI.

It has to.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nIn recent years, over 70 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emissions, aiming to become carbon neutral by mid-century. The 2015 Paris Agreement aimed to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Despite global efforts, emissions are still rising, and achieving the 1.5-degree goal has become increasingly difficult.\n\nMost pathways to keep warming below 2 degrees, and eventually return back to 1.5 rely on negative emissions, which involve pulling carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods like enhanced weathering and direct air capture.\n\nHowever, these techniques are still in early development stages, and require land, energy, and money. Critics argue that relying on CDR implicitly encourages governments and companies to postpone necessary emissions reductions because counting on CDR now means relying on future generations of leaders to deliver on those promises. Preventing emissions is broadly less costly than cleaning them up after the fact. But even with dramatic cuts to emissions, experts say some amount of CDR will still be necessary.\n\nSources and further reading: \nhttps://cdrprimer.org \nhttps://www.stateofcdr.org/\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/\nhttps://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-verification-explainer\nhttps://carbonplan.org/research \nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/competition-heats-up-for-u-s-direct-air-capture-program/\nhttps://skepticalscience.com/SkS_Analogy_10_Budgets_and_Bathtubs_2022.html\nhttps://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-environ-112320-105050 \nhttps://insideclimatenews.org/news/04122022/carbon-removal-fossil-fuels-wyoming/\nhttps://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker  \nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/ \nhttps://www.carbonremovalalliance.org/\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co2-emissions-region \nhttps://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement \nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country\nhttps://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-when-world-may-pass-1-5c-and-2c/ \nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/US_accessibleLTS2021.pdf\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices-vs-cumulative-capacity?yScale=linear \nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/166067/public-carbon-capture-climate\n\nMake sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox is an explanatory newsroom on a mission to help everyone understand our weird, wonderful, complicated world, so that we can all help shape it.

Most times, when you see the film’s actors struggling against high-level g-forces, that struggle is real. The actors spent months training to be in planes doing their own stunts, and the whole film feels grounded because of it.\n\nMost times these sequences were shot practically … but not every time. In the film's incredible seven-minute opener (also known as the Darkstar sequence), nearly everything we see is completely fake. The plane used to go Mach 10 doesn’t really exist yet. It’s a prototype for a plane that will exist in the future, built by Lockheed Martin. While a prototype of that plane was used for taxiing around the runway, anytime we see the plane in the air it’s entirely VFX — impeccable VFX. But beyond the VFX, the thing that makes it feel so real is the sound design. \n\nIn this video, Top Gun: Mavericks supervising sound producer Al Nelson breaks down the Darkstar sequence. He explains how his team made a plane that doesn’t exist sound real, and, more importantly, how they leveraged the sound design to be just as emotionally impactful as a piece of orchestrated music.\n\nNote: The headline on this piece has been updated.\nPrevious headline: How Top Gun made a fake plane sound real \n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

How did that happen?\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔 so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nOver the past few decades, children around the world have been diagnosed with nearsightedness at increasingly high rates. Nearsightedness, or myopia, can stabilize over time, but it doesn’t get better — meaning that myopes will rely on glasses, contact lenses, or corrective surgery to see for their entire lives. \n\nThe blurriness associated with myopia is caused by eyeballs that have grown too long; in a stretched-out shape, eyes aren’t able to properly focus images onto the retina. Researchers believe that two culprits are to blame: the lack of outdoor play, and prolonged time doing up-close activities like using digital devices. \n\nIn some countries — like Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, where over 80 percent of students graduating high school are myopic — intervening the progression of myopia has become a nationwide effort.  \n\nRead more about...\n\nThe global prevalence of myopia: https://www.aaojournal.org/article/s0161-6420(16)00025-7/fulltext#:~:text=We%20predict%20by%202050%20there,%2C%205.7%25%E2%80%9319.4%25%5D)\n\nHow time outdoors reduces myopia risk: https://bjo.bmj.com/content/104/5/593.abstract\n\nIntervention programs in Taiwan: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339125514_Increased_Time_Outdoors_Is_Followed_by_Reversal_of_The_Long-term_Trend_to_Reduced_Visual_Acuity_in_Taiwan_Primary_School_Students\n\nAnd intervention in Singapore: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027142/\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

For me, this moment came during the climax of the Pete Davidson film “The King of Staten Island,” where his most important line was impossible to understand. \n\nI had to rewind three times — and eventually put subtitles on — to finally pick up what he was saying.\n\nThis experience isn’t unique — gather enough people together and you can generally separate them into two categories: People who use subtitles, and people who don’t. And according to a not-so-scientific YouTube poll we ran on our Community tab, the latter category is an endangered species — 57% of you said you always use subtitles, while just 12% of you said you generally don’t.\n \nBut why do so many of us feel that we need subtitles to understand the dialogue in the things we watch?\n\nThe answer to that question is complex – and we get straight to the bottom of it in this explainer, with the help of dialogue editor Austin Olivia Kendrick.\n\nMake sure you never miss behind-the-scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: http://vox.com/video-newsletter\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

After over two years of lockdowns and quarantines, people eagerly restarted their lives, but there were certainly growing pains. Weddings and travel skyrocketed, but so did lost luggage and global inflation rates. Taylor Swift broke Ticketmaster. Cryptocurrency was headed toward a great year until it really, really wasn’t. 2022 tested the world population as we tested out life in a new phase of the pandemic.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine, and aid relief flooded into the war-torn country. Refugees were welcomed into surrounding countries, and those who stayed behind inspired people around the world. Global protests cried out for justice in Iran. Football teams stood up for migrant workers and the LGBTQ+ community at the World Cup. Cuba legalized same-sex marriage. The world froze for a moment when England’s longest-reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, died. And we all watched a lot of TikTok. \n\nAs we head into 2023, take a moment to look back at the events that defined this year.\n\nFor more on 2022 from Vox.com:\n\nAlissa Wilkinson’s The 25 best movies of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23484805/best-movies-2022-streaming-theaters\n\nConstance Grady’s Vox’s 16 best books of 2022: https://www.vox.com/culture/23500142/best-books-2022-if-i-survive-you-vladimir-furrows-lessons-either-or-ducks-joan-is-okay-shy-hotbed\n\nMarin Cogan’s Antisemitism isn’t new.

At that same meeting, they also announced that the 2018 World Cup would take place in Russia. These selections set off a new chapter in FIFA’s history, one where the public would have a greater sense on how bribery and corruption have a huge role in who gets to host this international sporting event. \n\nThe last 14 World Cup locations were decided by a group of 24 powerful men within FIFA called the executive committee. Their votes meant a lot to bidding nations and allegations on bidders bribing members of the committee lingered for decades. These allegations reached a new level when criminal investigations were launched nearly five years after that FIFA announcement. The fallout of these investigations nearly broke FIFA and tainted the World Cup. \n\nWatch the latest episode of Vox Atlas to understand how FIFA corrupted the World Cup host selection process.\n\nSources: \n\nWe found this book written and edited by dozens of football experts very helpful for understanding the financial history of FIFA and the World Cup: \n\nThe Business of the FIFA World Cup edited by Simon Chadwick, Paul Widdop, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Daniel Parnell\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781003121794/business-fifa-world-cup-simon-chadwick-paul-widdop-christos-anagnostopoulos-daniel-parnell \n\nWe used this research article to create charts showing the World Cup’s financial success in it’s early days: \n\nFinancing World Football.

                "description": "Get ready for school with Ms Rachel and Elmo! We are so excited to share this special video that’s packed with learning, key skills to prepare for preschool and kindergarten and fun kids songs and nursery rhymes! Join Ms Rachel and Elmo in singing, “This Is The Way We Go To School,” “The ABC Song” and practice 30 preschool skills! \n\nThe episode starts with Ms Rachel helping Elmo with his morning routine before he goes off to school! They model each step to getting ready! Routines are so helpful for little ones! Some children benefit from visuals for each step. It can be helpful to practice your morning routine before school starts. \n\nNext Ms Rachel and Elmo sing their ABCs together. (The Alphabet Song) This is a great song for your little one to know before they start school. Some children only know the letters in order. Practice recognizing them out of order as well! \n\nMs Rachel then models counting with cars and one to one correspondence, an important early math skill. Then we do our counting song, “1-20 Song.” Practice counting with your chid throughout the day, such as counting how many apples you are buying at the the store or how many stuffed animals your child is playing with. \n\nNext Ms Ashley does a fun game with the letter B and we sing our Phonics Song together. Ms Rachel created a motion for each letter which helps children with memorizing their letter sounds. \n\nHerbie then asks the children to help him figure out which words rhyme. Being able to identify and come up with rhymes is an important skill. \n\nNext Ms Rachel models what a full day of school might look like. When children know what to expect, they feel more comfortable with new situations. Ms Rachel also mentions throughout the video that the child’s grown up will be coming back to get them and they will go home at the end of the day. It may help to bring a laminated family photo or a special stuffy from home. \n\nMr Aron then talks a bit about another preschool skill, opposites! \n\nNext Ms Rachel teaches the days of the week and the months of the year with a catchy “Days of the Week Song” and “Months of The Year Song.” Kids songs & nursery rhymes are so helpful for learning. \n\nWe then talk once more about how first we go to school, then we go home at the end of the day. We are aiming with this video to help with butterflies and nervousness about being apart from parents and entering school. \n\nThen we sing the classic kids song, “The Wheels on the Bus” This song is so great for practicing imitation and gestures and it’s so fun! Get ready to dance along! \n\nNext Ms Rachel and Ashley model pretend play and teach the colors. Ms Rachel also models getting frustrated and taking a deep breath. As we mentioned, emotional regulation is such an important preschool skill. It’s actually the skill Kindergarten teachers said is the most important preschool skill in a survey. \n\nWe then sing “Bubble, Bubble Pop” a fun kids song that teaches colors and numbers. \n\nNext Ms Ashley goes over how to raise your hand and plays a listening game. \n\nAfter that Ms Rachel quizzes the children on whether they know their first name, last name, middle name and full name. She also encourages children to start learning to write their name. Give your toddlers large crayons to color with to strengthen fine motor skills. \n\nNext we have a learning cartoon that practices knowing the concepts of same and different. \n\nThen we move to practicing all of our phonics sounds and gestures! We take breaks throughout the alphabet and sing fun kids songs and nursery rhymes such as “Bingo,” “Lazy Lion” and “I’m So Happy.” \n\nWe go over sharing, trading and taking turns which are very important preschool prep skills that are often overlooked. When a child has good social skills and emotional regulation skills, they are more likely to succeed academically and make friends! Then we sing “I Could Be Your Friend” an original song! \n\nThen we go over our shapes with a fun elephant toy, which is a great math preschool skill. We sing our kids song, “Square Song.” We also sing “If You Should Meet an Elephant.” \n\nNext we talk about how it’s ok to have big feelings and sing our “Big Feelings” song. It’s normal to have big feelings, we just need tools to manage them. \n\nMs Rachel ends by sharing some of her experience with the first day of school and with some loving encouragement to the children watching!\n\nWe hope you enjoyed Ms Rachel + Sesame Street as much as we did! \n\nThis video is perfect for toddlers, preschoolers and even kindergarteners! Check out our channel for more toddler learning videos, toddler dance along videos, kids songs & nursery rhymes mixes and learn to read videos! We have videos for 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and 5 year olds! We absolutely love making toddler shows and we hope you enjoyed our program. \n\n#msrachel #elmo #kidssongs #nurseryrhymes #toddlerlearning #toddlers #preschool #preschoollearning",

As always, Ms Rachel uses research based methods, preschool curriculum and fun kids songs and nursery rhymes to teach and engage toddlers. Ms Rachel hopes to help make your child’s doctor checkup successful with this engaging toddler learning video. The doctor’s office is Manhattan Valley Pediatrics in New York City and the doctor is Dr Hoffman.  \n\nThe first song you will hear is a doctor checkup song written by Ms Rachel and Mr Aron. It explains what a doctor is and shows visuals for each step of a check up. Then Ms Rachel gets a real check-up from a real doctor! Dr Hoffman reminds us of healthy habits that are most important. Next we have two very special guests, Emma Memma and Dalia. We all sing the fun song, “Miss Polly Had A Dolly” together. In this video for toddlers, we also see Herbie at the doctor! We have multiple toddler learning segments with Ms Ashley such as learning the letter D and the meaning of the word different. Ms Rachel then models how children can do a pretend check up on a stuffed animal or their grown up at home with a toy doctor kit. Since kids learn best through play, Ms Rachel is always modeling this skill. It also helps children to incorporate things they are working through in their play, such as being comfortable going to the doctor for the first time. Mr Aron provides some humor as usual, because laughter and being silly are important, too! Throughout the video you will see tips for parents at the bottom of the screen to help make checkups as successful as possible. This is something Ms Rachel likes to do in all the videos for kids. Knowledge helps us feel empowered. \n\nWe also incorporate an original social story about going to the doctor, “I’m Going to the Doctor” written by Ms Rachel and illustrated by Loryn Brantz. Social stories are a great tool to help children feel better about a new experience or a situation that may cause them anxiety. We also incorporate other favorite nursery rhymes and kids songs after the doctor check up song. The doctor check-up song is called “A Doctor Is A Helper.” We wanted to write a doctor song for kids that you can sing with your child at home to make them feel better about going to the doctor. If you are interested in other educational videos for kids that help with key milestones and preschool learning standards, check out our home page! We have the best videos for toddlers because they are research based and taught by a real teacher, Ms Rachel! \n\n#kidssongs #nurseryrhymes #doctor #toddlerlearning #preschool #doctorsong",

                "description": "Have your baby learn first words with a real teacher, Ms Rachel! In this video, Ms Rachel will go over about 50 first words. She will also sing fun nursery rhymes and songs for babies to delight your little one! \n\nMs Rachel includes sign language for many of the words as well. She also encourages gestures, which help speech development. \n\nRemember, the best way for a baby to learn language is interacting with their caregiver. Here are some tips for helping your baby’s language and brain development: \n\nNarrate your day like a sportscaster - “I’m changing your diaper - wipe, wipe - all clean!” \n\nRead to your baby every day\n\nPlay on the floor with your baby. The best toy for your baby is you! \n\nBabble with your baby, imitate their sounds \n\nTalk to your baby \n\nHelp your baby experience and explore new environments such as outside, on a walk, story time at the library, safe spaces in your home \n\nRepeat words and speak slowly \n\nSpeak with enthusiasm in a high sing-songy tone (parentese) \n\nSing songs with your baby and sing songs with gestures like “The Wheels on the Bus” \n\nSoothe your baby when they are upset, pick them up when they cry \n\nGive appropriate, safe toys to explore \n\nGive your child lots of love and affection \n\nIf your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and contact early intervention for your state. If you qualify for early intervention, you can get therapies such as speech therapy and physical therapy. The sooner you get help, the better! \n\nFor more videos for babies, toddlers and preschoolers, check out our YouTube page!

                "description": "Ms Rachel will teach important 2 year old milestones and social skills for toddlers and preschoolers in this fun toddler learning video! Join her at the playground to play, learn, move, sing and make new friends! This is a great video for children ages two years old to four years old. Ms Rachel also incorporates fun nursery rhymes & kids songs into every episode. \n\nThis program is not a substitute for speech therapy, regular doctors check-ups or early intervention. If your child is not meeting milestones, call your pediatrician and call early intervention for your state. Some of the milestones in this episode are from the CDC’s developmental milestones. You can Google them and use them to monitor your child’s development. These are two year old milestones.\n\nThis episode may be helpful for autistic children who need extra support with social skills. Video modeling can be helpful for children who have autism. Ms Rachel loves making videos for toddlers and preschoolers. Making high quality, educational videos for toddlers  is her passion. We believe these are the best toddler learning videos out there because Ms Rachel is a real teacher and her content uses research based techniques, real preschool learning standards and Broadway inspired music, dance and movement songs for toddlers. \n\n#toddlervideos #kidssongs #toddlerlearning #toddlerlearningvideo #preschool #kidssongs #nurseryrhymes #toddlers #toddler #preschoollearning #preschoolactivities #msrachel #learning #education #educational #videosfortoddlers #kidsvideo #playground #kids",

Ms Rachel uses baby songs, nursery rhymes and play to show how to encourage speech and language development, cognitive skills and social emotional growth. \n\nTake Ms Rachel’s Baby Test and see how many gestures your baby can do! Try to get 16 gestures by 16 months old. Ms Rachel will show and encourage 18 gestures in the first 10 minutes of this video that you can work on with your child. Then she will model speech development from infants to 15 months old. She will also model pretend play which is an 18 month old milestone. Throughout the whole video, other key milestones are taught through fun kids songs, rhymes and play! Ms Rachel will also show sign language and first words. While babies watch, parents can learn more about their baby’s development and how to support them during this important time! \n\nAlso we have a very special guest this episode from the Today Show!

                "description": "Have your toddler learn with a real teacher, Ms Rachel! Ms Rachel has packed so much important learning into this “Learn Animals with Ms Rachel” special! Not only does she teach farm animals, animal sounds, zoo animals, and baby animal names, she sneaks in learning concepts to prepare children for preschool, such as modeling “what questions,” gestures, first words, first sentences, 5 W Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why) pretend play skills, counting, colors, shapes, numbers, letters and letter sounds! She includes fun nursery rhymes & kids songs that encourage movement and language development. She also teaches prepositions such as under, next to, on, behind, in and out! As always, you can count on Ms Rachel to encourage language, movement and engagement. She is a master at encouraging speech and making screen time active, not passive. This kind of screen time is more beneficial. Ms Rachel uses fun learning toys to engage and excite toddlers about learning and encourage speech.\n\nThe learning standards and milestones she encourages range from 9 month old milestones like clapping to 5 year old milestones such as using the words and phrases “behind” and “next to” correctly and asking and answering “why questions.” Young children will be challenged to learn more and older siblings can watch and learn together with little ones. “Songs for Littles” is better screen time for bright toddlers! Buzz Feed called it “The best educational YouTube channel!” \n\nIf your child is not meeting milestones, let your pediatrician know and call Early Intervention for your state. Your child may qualify for free or very low cost therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy. You can also contact a private speech therapist (speech language pathologist) for an evaluation. It’s best to act early and get your child help as soon as possible. \n\nSongs in this video include: \n\nOld Macdonald Had A Farm\nFive Little Ducks \nMary Had A Little Lamb \nWalkin’ At The Zoo \nIf You Should Meet An Elephant \nHop Little Bunnies \nTick Tock Cuckoo Clock \n5 Little Monkeys\nBananas Unite \nDo You Know What Shape This Is? \nRow, Row, Row Your Boat\nBingo \nLittle Bo Peep \n1-20 Song\nItsy Bitsy Spider \nAnts Go Marching\nABCs\nPlus more! \n\nMs Rachel also teaches about taking care of our pets and being gentle with our pets!

Have your child learn to talk with a real teacher, Ms Rachel!\n\nWhen Ms Rachel was teaching her little boy first sentences, she couldn’t find a video that showed sentences she wanted him to learn, such as “Up, mama! and “I want juice, please!” She ended up making him his own personal video of first sentences that worked wonderfully for him! Now she’s made this video for you and your child to practice first sentences!\n\nThis video may be helpful for children with a speech delays, but if your child has a speech delay, take these steps to ensure that they get the help they need to thrive! \n\n1. Talk to your pediatrician about your concerns\n2. Call your state’s early intervention program and request an evaluation (your child may qualify for free speech therapy and other therapies if needed)\n3. You could also seek out a private speech therapist for an evaluation and speech therapy if needed!\n\nTip:\nA great first sentence to practice is “I want milk” (or something your child really likes! For example TV, iPad, juice, toy) Here’s how you can help your child, gently prompting their signs hand over hand and having them say the word (if they can speak single words) \n\n1. You can help them point to themselves for “I” as you or they say \"I\"\n2. Help them do the sign for “want” as you or they say “want”\n3. Help them do the sign for “milk” as you or they say “milk” \n\nThen give them the milk right away and say,\n“Great job asking for milk!” For children who have special needs, it may also may be helpful to show a visual for each word such as a PECS system.\n\n\"Georgie\" puppet  Copyright 2016 - David Fino & The Brooklyn Puppet Conspiracy.

In this Toddler Learning Video, you will learn all 26 letters of the alphabet and all of their sounds! We also show both the uppercase and lowercase letters to help your child become familiar with both. After all of the letters and sounds we will show the alphabet song. Phonics, phonics songs and learning letter sounds are an excellent way to start helping your child learn to read. You will also see hand cues for many of the sounds. We wanted to create a video with all of the letters and all of their sounds, that also showed a catchy and easy to remember song to practice the sounds. We know you will love learning your ABCS with Ms Rachel and her team of experts in early childhood education. \n\nIf your child learns to identify their letters (uppercase and lowercase) and even some of their letter sounds before preschool and kindergarten, they will be in excellent shape! You should also focus on teaching them social emotional skills such as how to share, take turns, what to do when another child takes a toy they are playing with, how to handle big emotions and self regulation. Social emotional skills are incredibly important for success in preschool! \n\nIf you think your child has a speech delay or is not meeting their milestones, definitely talk to your pediatrician now. Also, call early intervention.  Every state in the United States has Early Intervention. You may qualify for free speech therapy or other therapies through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a private speech therapist. The earlier you do this, the better!

Next we’ll move to a learning segment where Ms. Rachel encourages babies and toddlers to practice their speech. Ms. Rachel alternates fun kids songs with learning sessions to keep children engaged, interactive and full of joy! Through the whole video, Ms. Rachel is sneaking in the teaching and practicing milestones for babies and toddlers such as speech, imitation, identifying parts of the body, pretend play, gestures and knowing colors, numbers and letters. \n\nResearch shows that the most beneficial screen time is interactive and Ms. Rachel carefully plans all of her material to be incredibly interactive and engaging. We also believe in the benefit of seeing real people modeling speech and gestures! All of our videos are based on research and we have many experts on our team such as a speech therapist and an early childhood curriculum expert. Ms. Rachel also includes baby sign language, which is shown to help with communication and speech development!\n\nIf you think your child has a speech delay or is not meeting their milestones, definitely talk to your pediatrician now. Also, call early intervention. Every state in the United States has Early Intervention. You may qualify for free speech therapy or other therapies through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a private speech therapist. The earlier you do this, the better! \n\n\"Georgie\" puppet  Copyright 2016 - David Fino & The Brooklyn Puppet Conspiracy.

She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. She has worked in homes to support families with children with special needs.

These are taught to your baby by a real music teacher, Ms Rachel, who has a masters in music education and is a music teacher who has taught live baby, toddler and preschool music classes. Music is a phenomenal way to encourage milestones such as gestures, speech, pretend play and joint attention. It’s also great to have a real person showing the gestures to your child instead of a cartoon. They are more easily able to mimic the motions and hear the language!\n\nMs. Rachel picked this list carefully because of these baby song’s ability to teach language, animal sounds, gestures, body part names, pretend play, milestones like clapping and baby sign language. \n\nHop Little Bunnies \nItsy Bitsy Spider \nOpen Shut Them \nIcky Sticky Bubblegum \nWheels on the Bus \n5 Little Ducks\nHurry, Hurry Drive the Firetruck \nHead, Shoulders, Knees and Toes \nPatty Cake, Patty Cake Bakers Man\nOld MacDonald \nIf You’re Happy and You Know It \nPatty Cake \nBaby Shark \nBubble, Bubble Pop \nBingo \nWe Are The Dinosaurs by Laurie Berkner \nWhere is Thumbkin? \nRow Your Boat \nZoom, Zoom, Zoom We’re Going To The Moon\nThe More We Get Together \nOnce I Caught A Fish Alive \nTrain Song\nMary Had A Little Lamb\n5 Little Monkeys Swinging From A Tree\nIf All The Raindrops Were Lemondrops and Gumdrops\nHere We Go Looby Loo \nThe ABCs (The Alphabet Song) \nBaby Beluga \n5 Little Monkeys Jumping on The Bed \nA Quiet Little Mouse \n1, 2 Buckle My Shoe \n5 Little Hotdogs \nTeddy Bear, Teddy Bear Turn Around \nMonkeys (Spoken Version) \nBaby Sign Language Songs\nBrown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See book with song \n\nTips: \nYou can sit behind your baby and, hand over hand, help them do the gestures - (if they enjoy that) \nDon’t bounce them around unless they have head control - not for newborns \nBe animated and enthusiastic when you sing to babies \n\nOther fun ideas: \nAdd bubbles to your music play with your child \nAdd colorful scarves and dance around with them, play peek-a-boo with them \nHave stuffed animals play along, make stuffed animals clap and do gestures \nIf walking, march around to the beat of the music\n\nIf working on speech development with a toddler, sing slow and leave out the last word of the phrase of the song!

                "description": "Our videos for babies and toddlers teach animal sounds, first words and encourage baby and toddler speech and language development learning. We use techniques recommended by speech therapists. Join us as we learn about pets and animal sounds in this fun “Talking Time” video! After pets, you will see some of our farm animal video and then some slow speech exercises. We hope you find the toddler speech learning exercises, activities and techniques helpful. \n\nIf you think your child may have a speech delay, talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through early intervention. You can also get an assessment from a speech therapist. The sooner you get help, the better! \n\nJust to be clear, we ourselves are not speech therapists. Rachel has a masters in music education and teaches preschool music.  She has also taught many toddler classes. If you are in New York City and are seeking a speech therapist, check out www.chatterboxnyc.com The brilliant speech therapists at Chatterbox are highly recommended and helped with our “Speech Techniques for Toddlers” video. \n\nWe also include toddler songs and baby songs in our toddler speech learning videos. Simple songs can help the development of language and gestures! Gestures and imitation are building blocks that help with language development. We also include some sign language and pretend play. Baby sign language can help with the development of language and will not impede the development of language and speech. We also model pretend play. Pretend play is an important toddler skill. \n\nIn this video we will go over the following animal sounds: Dog, cat, bunny rabbit and farm animals, cow, duck, pig, sheep and horse. Animal sounds are a great way to encourage your child to make sounds and experiment with their voice. A fun toy that may encourage language is a toy barn with toy farm animals. You can get right down on the floor at your child’s level and make the animal sounds. It may help to hold a toy by your mouth so they look at the way your mouth produces the sounds.\n\nThis video may also be helpful to children with apraxia, autism, down syndrome and other developmental delays and special needs. We hope the speech activities, exercises, lessons and training are helpful! This video is great for a baby, 1 year old, 2 year old, 3 year old, 4 year old and even older! \n\nOn our channel, we have many more speech practice videos (see our speech playlist) and we also have free preschool class videos (see our preschool class playlist) and full music classes!

                "description": "Learn to talk with this Toddler Learning Video - Learn At The Playground - a speech development practice video for toddlers and babies that includes songs, social skills, social emotional learning and more! ! This video encourages children to talk with methods and techniques recommended by speech therapists. It uses motivating toys and playground equipment to show children the power of communication and using their voice! We also include many songs because simple songs are shown to help with the development of language and gestures! Gestures and imitation are building blocks of language. We also include some sign language. Baby sign language can help with the development of language and will not impede the development of language. \n\nIf you think your child may have a speech delay, definitely talk with your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. You deserve help and are not alone! \n\nThis video may also be helpful to children with apraxia, autism, down syndrome and other developmental delays. We hope the speech activities, exercises, and training are helpful! The video also includes social emotional  learning and social skills training for toddlers!\n\nRachel is not a speech therapist, but on several videos she has worked with speech therapists to share helpful techniques for speech practice. \n\n\"Georgie\" puppet  Copyright 2016 - David Fino & The Brooklyn Puppet Conspiracy.

This toddler learning video takes place at an outdoor playground to motivate children to use language and to model social emotional skills such as asking a friend to play and taking turns.

She also emphasizes signs, gestures, and imitation, which are three building blocks of language development. As a music educator with a masters in music education, she often uses songs to practice these skills. Rachel also works hard to make her videos very interactive, because interactive screen time is shown to have a much greater benefit than passive screen time. \n\nIf you suspect your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician.

                "description": "On Nov. 16, 2022, the Orion spacecraft launched aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center and embarked on the #Artemis I mission to the Moon and back. Orion orbited the Moon, getting as close as 79 miles to the lunar surface, and successfully splashed back down to Earth 25.5 days later on Dec. 11.\n \nFour RS-25 engines and two five-segment solid rocket boosters provided more than 8.8 million pounds of thrust for SLS during liftoff and flight. Thanks in part to development of a new RS-25 engine controller that checks engine health 50 times per second, engineers were able to collect more than 100 measurements on pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and vibrations on the four RS-25 engines that helped power Artemis I. The preliminary post-flight data indicates that all SLS systems performed exceptionally and that the designs are ready to support a crewed flight on Artemis II.\n \nThe Artemis II mission will bring us closer to establishing a sustained human presence on the lunar surface and landing the first woman and first person of color on the Moon.\n \nThis video was captured from the Launch Pad 39B perimeter and was used by engineers to monitor and track the rocket during flight.\n \nVideo credit: NASA\nMusic credit: Universal Production Music",

                "description": "Cameras on NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft give us amazing views of our adventure around the Moon. See up close views of the Moon from external cameras as well as the view from inside the capsule.\n\nOrion is the only spacecraft capable of carrying humans from Earth on Artemis missions to deep space and bringing them back to Earth from the vicinity of the Moon. More than just a crew module, Orion has a launch abort system to keep astronauts safe if an emergency happens during launch, and a European-built service module that is the powerhouse that fuels and propels Orion and keeps astronauts alive with water, oxygen, power, and temperature control, as well as a heat shield that can handle high-speed returns from deep space. SLS is the most powerful rocket in the world and the only rocket capable of launching Orion with astronauts and their supplies on Artemis missions to the Moon.\n\nOrion launched on the SLS rocket from Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2022. Artemis I is an uncrewed flight test of our SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and exploration ground systems for future Artemis missions—which will provide the foundation to send humans to the lunar surface, develop a long-term presence on and around the Moon, and pave the way for humanity to set foot on Mars.\n\nMore about Artemis: https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-i/\n\nCredit: NASA",

As a part of NASA’s overall planetary defense strategy, DART’s impact with the asteroid Dimorphos will help to determine whether asteroid deflection using a kinetic impactor spacecraft is a viable mitigation technique for protecting the planet from an Earth-bound asteroid or comet, if one were discovered. Johns Hopkins APL manages the DART mission for NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office as a project of the agency's Planetary Missions Program Office. Neither DART’s target asteroid, Dimorphos, nor its larger asteroid parent, Didymos, poses a hazard to Earth.\n\nParticipants include:\n\n• NASA Administrator Bill Nelson\n• Italian Space Agency President Giorgio Saccoccia\n\nDART update panel:\n• Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington\n• Tom Statler, DART program scientist at NASA Headquarters\n• Nancy Chabot, DART coordination lead at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland\n\nMore on DART: https://nasa.gov/dart\n\nCredit: NASA",

            "description": "This is Juice WRLD's official channel.\n\nChicago-area hip-hop musician Juice WRLD delivers introspective lyrics atop melodic production, echoing Travis Scott and Post Malone. Born Jarad Higgins in 1998, the Calumet Park artist grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice.\n\nHis early tracks were all posted online, leading up to 2017's Juice WRLD 999 EP. Produced by Nick Mira and Sidepce, the set included the singles \"Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)\" and \"All Girls Are the Same\". Both tracks would also land on his official debut full-length album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 upon release in May 2018."

Kai took us to the Safe House by force and is now acting really suspicious! Can we trust Kai or was saving this criminal a mistake? Kai has dangerous weapons and could be leading us to traps while my husband Chad Wild Clay and my friends Shinobi and Reo watch Kai while he tries to help them find files that will reveal the location of Deletion Day which is Scattered Skull's new Doom's Day event that will shut down and delete youtube forever! But while searching the house my friend Stormi and I heard strange knocking coming from behind a door! Could it be a person or an animal? Are they held hostage or is this another one of Kai's traps?! Using my lock picking skills we were able to get it but we found a blue tarp! Hopefully not another crazy man jumps out and runs away but we need to save him! Eventually Kai seems to have betrayed us and left us behind while Scattered Skull arrived and we had to battle royale fight them! Once we chased after Kai we ran into Burn Face's next arson fire attack! We sneak past the fire trucks and ambulances and found an old Scattered Skull Storage Bunker on fire! There were so many firefighters trying to put out the fire and someone got put into a stretcher and is on their way to the hospital now! Was it Kai? Was this criminal telling the truth?

Our puppy is bleeding now and we have to get him to the hospital but Burn Face and his Scattered Skull Initiates are trying to stop us and kidnap our dog Clue! My friend Stormi and I split off to go find places inside Spy Ninjas HQ to hide Clue from Scattered Skull while my Chad Wild Clay and friends Shinobi and Reo stay behind to fight off the Initiates and Burn Face in a battle royale!

We follow the trail of blood left behind our injured dog Clue and we had to chase Clue all around HQ to the point that our dog starting walking me for 24 hours it felt like! Once we finally found our missing dog we met up with Chad and the boys and had to take out the rest of Scattered Skull on a stealth mission! Unfortanetly we had to escape Burn Face's flamethrower attack and ran into an elevator which turned out to be a trap! The cables snapped and we had to use the emergency breaks to save our dog's life! But then we got ambushed by Scattered Skull and they kidnapped Clue!! We chased after them and got him back and decided to hide in my secret room underneath our trampoline park!

Using evidence and clues left behind at the crime scene there was blood all over her pillow leading to a bloody fingerprint on a security camera! After watching the footage we realized a former project zorgo hacker PZ6, otherwise known as Burn Face, captured and kidnapped our friend Stormi! We followed them to HQ and had to lock pick and disable security cameras in order to break into Spy Ninjas HQ. Once we were in we found Burn Face using his flamethrower! We split up to search for Stormi but all we can find are body bags! Are we too late? Is our best friend Stormi dead?

That's when we saw a man hiding inside our car while looking through the windshield. Who is this person living inside our Tesla? We need to unmask him, do a face reveal and learn his identity. We tried our best to convince him to come out but he refused to leave. Does he think this is some kind of last to leave challenge? We tried opening the door but a weapon fell out and he closed the door on us. Now we know this person is armed and dangerous so we called the police and then called our friends for backup. We tried all kinds of tricks such as annoying the man, turning up the heat inside, offering him food, but then he started handing us mysterious cryptic notes through the crack in the window. Our friends Stormi and Reo got angry and frustrated and used the Tesla app to drive the car around, nearly getting into a car crash, trying to scare the guy to come out but it didn't work. If I were in there I would have had an accident! The final attempt was when Reo throw a smoke grenade inside.

Eventually they took the boxes Chad and I were in inside the Scattered Skull bunker and when we finally escaped the boxes we were trapped behind a cage! Luckily Reo and Stormi were able to find us by finding one of the boxes that fell out of the truck on the way here which had the blue tarp in it which helped lead to our location! They had to fight against Initiates who were standing guard and Reo pushed an Initiate down the stairs! Using my lock picking skills I managed to escape from the cage we were trapped in and using the help of all the Spy Ninjas we locked Shinobi behind a cage! Now we are able to escape and avoid being killed by the Assassin but Shinobi kept saying we were making a mistake, can we trust Shinobi or has he officially betrayed the Spy Ninjas and is now apart of Scattered Skull for good?\n\nThe World's Most Fun Adventure Park!\n▶ Spy Ninjas HQ - https://spyninjashq.com/\n7980 W Sahara Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89117\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube",

Shinobi fought with all of his strength but a Scattered Skull Initiate was able to cut his face with a knife! Now with Shinobi bleeding it looks like he might lose the fight but he gave every last bit of energy he had into trying to defeat Scattered Skull but unfortunately he was too outnumbered and Shinobi and intern were captured! Meanwhile while Chad left to go get the first aid kit Reo woke up and we tried our best to save Stormi's life. Once Chad came back we bandaged up her wounds and now she might be alive... but barely! We decided to grab axes from axe throwing and join Shinobi and Intern in their fight but once we got there the Assassin and the Initiates were gone! Shinobi said he had no choice but to betray the Spy Ninjas and tell the Scattered Skull Assassin the location of Stormi! We raced back to Stormi and rescued her from the Assassin but now we need to escape a compromised HQ and protect Stormi at all costs!

After almost an hour, when it's clear Evil Twin Stormi is not showing up, Shinobi chokes up and tries to leave. Chad comes up with an idea to save the night, and not crush Shinobi's spirit. I dress up as Evil Twin Stormi and pretend to be his date for the night. As long as I don't get caught, Shinobi and everyone else will have a great time. Reo of course has to try to ruin my plan though when he figures out that I'm pretending to be Red. Will Shinobi have one of the best date nights of his life, or will I get caught and jeopardize our friendship???\n\nThe World's Most Fun Adventure Park!\n▶ Spy Ninjas HQ - https://spyninjashq.com/\n7980 W Sahara Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89117\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube",

I forgot our anniversary was today and now I need to do whatever it takes to make it up to my wife Vy Qwaint! Starting with a boquet of flowers I got with the help of my friends, Shinobi and Reo, we surprised Vy to try to cheer her up! Unfortanetly she was filming a video with her friend Stormi about how to control her anger which backfired because Stormi freaked out and smashed the flowers everywhere that I got for Vy! The boys and I are going to have to think of more romantic gestures so I can win back Vy's love! I tried to swing on a rope like Tarzan to sweep Vy off her feet but I accidentally crashed into her and Stormi while they were doing yoga. I tried learning a romantic song to play for Vy that Reo taught me but since I was pretty bad at it Stormi and Vy freaked out even more while they were doing bubble popping asmr! Then I tried giving Vy one of her favorite candles to take her stress away but I accidentally dropped it on a spiderman pinata Vy and Stormi were beating up and it caught on fire! I grabbed the hose and sprayed the fire out but I accidentally sprayed water all over Vy and Stormi! Now they're kicking dodgeballs and if I don't think of a way to make it up to Vy for me forgetting our anniversary, the dodgeballs won't be the only thing that will get kicked today!\n\nThe World's Most Fun Adventure Park!\n▶ Spy Ninjas HQ - https://spyninjashq.com/\n7980 W Sahara Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89117\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube",

Chad doesn't trust Reo, but Vy thinks that there's still good in Reo after she saw how he behaved when Chad was missing. The Spy Ninjas agree that Reo can stay if he agrees to go through six trust building challenges with Shinobi. If there's a tie after all six games the two will have to have a boxing match to see who is the ultimate winner.\n\nShinobi bets Reo that if he wins Reo has to leave forever, but if Reo wins he can take Shinobi's place in the Spy Ninjas. Shinobi and Reo go through various trust exercises including trust fall, minefield challenge, team rock climbing, and the floor is lava. Who will win? Will Shinobi and Reo actually have to fight it out?

We have to protect Shinobi and get him to saftey while avoiding attempted murder with a plastic bag over his head, poisonous gas in our fruit chop room, and almost falling to our deaths in an elevator crash! Chad and I had no choice but to fight this new Scattered Skull Killer to get Shinobi to escape but the assassin knew our weaknesses and pressure pointed us! Once we escaped we saw on a facetime call Shinobi get hit by a car and crash! We need to find our missing friend and see if he survived the car crash. The police showed up and we told them about our situation but we still need to find Shinobi and find out if he's alive and who this assassin is and why is he after our friend!?\n\nThe World's Most Fun Adventure Park!\n▶ Spy Ninjas HQ - https://spyninjashq.com/\n7980 W Sahara Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89117\n\n▶ Official Spy Ninjas Website - https://www.spyninjas.net/\n▶ SPY NINJAS GADGETS - https://spyninjasgadgets.com/\n▶ SPY NINJAS & CWC Merch - https://www.spyninjasstore.com/\n▶ SPY NINJA Mobile App Game - https://spyninja.page.link/cwcyoutube",

                "description": "We Spent 365 Days Building the PERFECT Underground Luxury Villa and WaterPark\n- About Mr.Heang Update:\nIt took us about a year to build this underground luxury classic villa. In this video, we will share some experiences about the activities we have done. It's a surprising result that we can do with just the simple tools and simple construction methods to achieve stunning results.\n\nI see a lot of opinions saying that we lie and use machines. But what is 100 percent true is that we spent a lot of time and hard work to build this house using the same materials as in the video.\n\n- About the construction site\nWe do not yet have a specific base location, we always move from place to place for new experiences and new feelings.\nThe location we are currently working on is in South Asia, we have our next project in North America soon, and our next favorite country is The United States of America (USA), the United States (U.S.) or America.\n\n\n- How many of us and how long does it take to do it?\n\nWe started this hard work as a team with three or four of us, one of whom is a videographer and the other two or three are builders. It takes about 400 days from start to finish 100%.\n\n- How big is this beautiful house? \n\nThis beautiful house was big enough to accommodate about 4 of us.\nThe house is 12 meters long and about 21 meters wide. This beautiful Classic Villa has a swimming pool, basement, kitchen, sitting area, and two separate bedrooms.\n\nIf you have any ideas, please leave a comment below my video.\n\nWe are very happy for your constructive feedback. \nWe hope all of you enjoy our videos !! \n#Building #Survival  #northamerica  #unitedstates\n------------------------------------- \nContact us\nEmail: misterheang@gmail.com\nFollow me on my Facebook Page ( Mr.Heang Viral )\nFollow me on Instagram.com/heangupdate\n➝ Allow to share/embed my video to any sites with a credit link \n➝ Don't allow copying/re-upload of my videos on (YouTube & Facebook)\n------------------------------------- \nCamera: Nikon D7500, Sony A7 IV, GoPro Hero 10, Drone DJI Mavic 3\nLen: Tokina 11-16mm, Sony 16-35mm\nEditing: DaVinci Resolve",
