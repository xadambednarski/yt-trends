We really hope you can tell!!!!\n\nIf you enjoyed the show, please consider supporting us with our NEW Murder Drones merch -- all proceeds will go into funding the artists, staff, and next show!\n\nFinally, we wanted to say that although this is the end of Murder Drones as a series, we may want to do more with Uzi and N.... who knows! We can do anything we want with indie animation 😄\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING FOR ALL THIS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",

                "description": "Adidas was my introduction to the world of sneakers.  From the time I can remember my pops kept 2 pairs of Adidas Country’s in his closet.  The Axel Foley’s. 1 pair was violently grass stained with dirt imbedded in any leather crease it could cling to.  He went to war every weekend against blades of grass and soil in the yard until they practically became frozen on his feet.  The other pair he kept on ice, pristine condition waiting for the day they’d be called up to replace the beaters and live a life of their own.  I studied them.  The three stripes, the green/white color-way, the Trefoil logo that adorned the heal.  They were perfect.  I wanted a pair. \n\nFast forward to today, and I ended up with something better.  We have our own shoe and an entire collection.  Adidas/Bogey Boys.  It feels surreal to type the words.  Thank you to all the folks on the Adidas Golf team, who took a chance with some kids from Seattle.  We got to celebrate together last night in LA and reflect on our first meetings, designs that got tossed and what ended up being the heart of the collection.  The green we used and the heritage Trefoil logo is for my pops and the 5 year old me that fell in love with those stripes.  \n\nThis game at its core brings people together.  We tell stories of past rounds, help each other read putts, make up excuses of why we aren’t as good as the last time we played and search for a little white golf ball in stubborn bushes all over the world.  It teaches me life lessons every time I set out with my clubs rattling in the trunk.  I’ve met so many life long friends in the past 4 years I’ve been immersed in the sport, connections that extend far beyond the fairways.  It’s the greatest game I’ve ever known and I’m so grateful I found it.  \n\nI hope you find a piece/pieces from the collection that you resonate with.  That will be worn during your best and worst rounds and become part of your golf/life story.  Inevitably it’s that one shot that keeps you coming back.  But while you’re searching for it, you might as well look the best on the course.  ❤️",

                "description": "Hard to put into words what it means to come back to Dublin and feel the level of love I experienced these first 2 shows of tour.\n\nIn a season where I’m struggling to fully love and accept myself that Dublin crowd reminded me I’m right where I’m suppose to be. It was a wake up call to push through. To keep going even when it feels impossible and everything in you just wants to shut down. It was a reminder that music was, is and always will be medicine. And the holistic connection I have to my art is actualized when I’m singing these songs with you guys.\n\nThank you for coming. For knowing the new songs. For dancing and getting outside your comfort zones. And for making me feel seen. I really really needed that ❤️\n\nhttps://macklemore.com/shows/\nhttp://macklemore.co/ben\n\nConnect With Macklemore:\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@macklemore\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/macklemore/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/MacklemoreLLC\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/macklemore\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/3JhNCzhSMTxs9WLGJJxWOY?si=ja846B6fTxmLA1Pq2gY2cQ\nWebsite: https://macklemore.com/\n\n#Macklemore #Shorts #tour #BEN #NewMusic #NoBadDays #NBDBEN",

                "description": "I wrote this song towards the end of my time on AGT. I’ve never felt more like a pawn on a chessboard than during this show. It reminded me just how cruel the industry can be and also made me incredibly grateful that I have had such a long successful career while somehow avoiding showbiz antics. And it was during this process that I knew without a doubt that no matter what I’ve been through, what I still have to go through, the music makes it all worth it.

It hasn't made life drama free but it sure has cut down on the amount of it I have to deal with… If I’ve got to cut someone off I will do it with no hesitation and no regrets… this girl loves boundaries… If I have to sue someone I’ll sue them (did that recently… not much fun but worth it) If a boy hurts me I break it off, if a friend betrays me I let them go.

There were a few late nights when I first started working in LA that I went down the dangerous path of what ifs. What if I had stayed?

It made me think of all the other times in my life where I was so sure of an outcome but was painfully reminded that fate has far more control over the eb and flow of life than I do… When I ended my first engagement… when I got my heart destroyed for the first time… when I realized I might never be able to have a baby… knowing my Grandma will never meet my kids if I can even manage to have any… none of these things were at all what I imagined would happen in my life… but beautiful things have come as a result of each of these things… so I have to trust that there is a reason, let go of what I cannot control and allow what is meant to be to come to me… Hope you enjoy this song 'Dreams Die Hard' from my album called 'Hollywood Dead'.\nxoxo Madilyn Bailey\n\nlisten to this song anywhere you listen to music...\nhttps://stem.ffm.to/HollywoodDead\n\nMy recent videos! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mZ9q210nnw&list=PL82F3756F525E643E&index=1\nMy Merch! - https://madilyn.net/collections/products  \nMy original music! - https://open.spotify.com/artist/07r7OPIALkj6Icaoj4Kf5l?si=qwPYJcrBSr6SduWBw2pV3A \n\nOTHER PLACES YOU CAN FIND MY FACE\nYOUTUBE - Madilyn\nFACEBOOK - Madilyn\nTWITTER - Madilyn\nINSTAGRAM - Madilyn\nTikTok - MadilynBailey",
