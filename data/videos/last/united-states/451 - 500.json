The Fun Squad must work together, navigating the dangers in their home, to reach their father's supercomputer and thwart Dr. Bad Guy's plans before time runs out. \n\nFun Squad MERCH:  https://www.TheFunSquadStore.com\n\nCheck Out Our Other Fun Squad YouTube Channels Here:\nFun Squad Family: https://www.youtube.com/@FunSquadFamily\nJazzy Skye: https://www.youtube.com/@JazzySkye\nJack Skye: https://www.youtube.com/@JackSkyeOfficial\nKade Skye: https://www.youtube.com/@KadeSkye\n\nFun Squad Website:  https://www.TheFunSquad.com\n\nFun Squad Social Media:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/FunSquad\n\nBusiness email:  Admin@TheFunSquad.com\nFan email:  FanMail@TheFunSquad.com\nMailing address:  PO Box 941, Riverton, UT 84065",

                "title": "Cómo bajar los TRIGLICÉRIDOS solo con REMEDIOS CASEROS",
                "description": "Hoy te enseñaré los 5 mejores remedios naturales para bajar los triglicéridos, fácilmente y desde tu propia casa. \nNúmero 1. El agua de avena con canela\nLa avena tiene betaglucanos, una fibra soluble muy buena para ti, ya que al tomar avena te ayudará a absorber muchas de las grasas que están atrapadas en tu intestino, pero si la juntas con un poco de canela, con sus antioxidantes tendrás la receta perfecta para disminuir los triglicéridos y el colesterol. Y para prepararla solo necesitarás dejar reposar en agua por toda la noche media taza de avena en hojuelas con una rama de canela. Tómala todos los días y preferiblemente en ayunas. Pero lo mejor de todo es que también la avena normal del desayuno que ya preparas, cumple la misma función con un poco de canela en polvo encima.\nNúmero 2. La Alcachofa\nLa alcachofa tiene cinarina, una sustancia ideal para todo lo que se trate de combatir el colesterol en tu cuerpo y hacer que tu organismo trabaje mejor. La mejor forma de consumirlas es al vapor y cocidas, después de haberla limpiado y recortado. Con la alcachofa vas a prevenir la obesidad, los infartos y hasta la diabetes. También puedes usar como un té poderoso una taza del agua que queda después de hervir las alcachofas y tomar hasta tres veces al día.\nNúmero 3. La albahaca\nLa albahaca tiene aceites esenciales muy ricos en antioxidantes que pueden ayudarte a combatir el daño de los triglicéridos altos. Para preparar el té de albahaca coloca una taza de agua a hervir y luego añade media cucharada de albahaca. Tapa y deja reposar durante 5 a 10 minutos, por último, cuela y bebe de 2 a 3 tazas de té por día. Y no estaría mal añadirle de vez en cuando a tus comidas, algunas hojas de albahaca frescas, porque fortalecerá mucho tu cuerpo y a la larga te traerá más salud.\nNúmero 4. El té de cúrcuma\nLa cúrcuma tiene otros antioxidantes que en el mundo son muy usados para algunas de las mejores medicinas para tu cuerpo y que eliminarán la grasa y las toxinas que estén en tu organismo. Para preparar el té de cúrcuma, coloca una taza de agua a hervir y luego añade una cucharadita de cúrcuma. Tapa y deja reposar durante 5 a 10 minutos, por último, cuela y bebe hasta 3 tazas de té por día.\n\nNúmero 5. El té verde\nY por último, si tienes té verde en tu casa, empieza a tomarlo más seguido, porque el té verde tiene catequinas, flavonoides y muchos otros compuestos antioxidantes que te ayudarán a disminuir los niveles de colesterol malo y triglicéridos en la sangre. Puedes tomarte hasta 3 tazas de té verde al día para resultados rápidos. Cada vez hay más estudios que demuestran lo bueno que es y además, previene el envejecimiento y mejora tus defensas.\nPor supuesto, no es recomendable tomar cualquiera de estas recetas en exceso, ni combinarlas todas en un solo día. Recuerda siempre consultar con tu médico personal antes de consumir cualquiera de estos ingredientes.",

Aunque la canción de introducción fue adaptada por el compositor francés Jean-Jacques Perrey a partir de una pieza de Beethoven llamada \"La Marcha Turca\", la música de apertura original del programa también fue compuesta por Ludwig van Beethoven en honor a la obra \"Las Ruinas de Atenas\". La canción \"The Elephant Never Forgets\" de Perrey se convirtió en el opening de la serie y fue utilizada sin dar crédito al autor, lo que resultó en una demanda millonaria en 2010. A pesar de esto, la música sigue siendo muy popular en toda Latinoamérica.\n#chespirito \n#curiosidades \n#historia",

                "description": "Hoy te enseñaré 3 remedios caseros para eliminar la tos rápidamente y cómo prepararlos. \nNúmero 1. Agua con sal\nSi estás tosiendo con flemas y arrastrando la mucosidad cada vez que toses, es porque tienes tos productiva. Necesitas sacarte toda esa flema y puedes hacerlo muy fácilmente haciendo gárgaras con agua y sal. Disuelve media cucharadita de sal en un vaso con agua caliente, deja que enfríe un poco y ahora si puedes hacer gárgaras por algunos minutos con esta solución, luego escupirla y enjuagar bien. Esta mezcla va a reducir las flemas y la mucosidad que está atrapada, aliviará la irritación de la garganta y hará que dejes de toser luego de un rato de haber hecho las gárgaras.\nNúmero 2. La miel\nSi te pica mucho la garganta y no tienes casi nada de moco, pero no paras de toser ni por la noche, tienes tos seca… Y lo mejor para quitarla es la miel. Tómate una cucharada de miel, o también puedes diluirla en agua, leche o bebidas que sean buenas para la tos seca como el jugo de naranja, el té de jengibre, el té de cúrcuma y el té de menta. La viscosidad de la miel crea una capa que te calma y protege de la irritación. La miel es antibiótica, antibacteriana y expectorante, que también te ayudará a expulsar toda esa flema que no ha podido salir por la tos seca para que luego no sigas tosiendo.\nNúmero 3. El agua\nSiempre que tengas tos, sin importar del tipo que sea, necesitas mantenerte bien hidratado. Tomar suficiente agua, especialmente si está a temperatura ambiente y no fría, va a aliviar casi todos los tipos de síntomas que puede tener la tos y los resfriados, porque desinflama, refresca y limpia tu garganta al igual que otras partes importantes de tu cuerpo que influyen en tu recuperación contra las enfermedades. Y por supuesto los caldos suaves, las infusiones de hierbas, los jugos de frutas y otras bebidas calientes, te hidratarán tanto como el agua y te aliviarán cuando más lo necesitas.\nRecuerda siempre consultar con tu médico personal antes de ejecutar alguna de estas recomendaciones\n#lunacreciente #salud #remedioscaseros",

Irás removiendo la mezcla por máximo 30 minutos y luego dejarás la olla con la mezcla reposando lejos del fuego hasta que enfríe. Y para finalizar, ayudándote con un colador, coloca el resultado en un frasco de vidrio con tapa, que deberás guardar fuera de la luz del sol para que mantenga sus propiedades. Este aceite no tiene contraindicaciones y podrás aplicar pequeñas cantidades para masajear en las áreas afectadas a diario si no eres alérgico a ninguno de los ingredientes.

                "description": "Hoy te enseñaré 3 beneficios que seguramente no conocías de las hojas de guayaba para tu salud. Antes de finalizar este vídeo te enseñaré cómo preparar el té con hojas de guayaba, que es la forma de obtener sus mejores propiedades. Recuerda darle me gusta a este vídeo y suscribirte a nuestro canal activando la campanita para que puedas seguir disfrutando de más material como éste\nNúmero 1. Mejora tu digestión y te ayuda a bajar de peso\nSi quieres mejorar la salud en tu estómago y sistema digestivo, la guayaba tiene fibras como la pectina que limpia y trae bienestar a tu intestino. Evita que crezcan microbios que puedan producirte enfermedades y malestar. También contiene astringentes como los taninos, que te quitarán la diarrea y aliviarán cualquier indigestión con tan solo tomarte una taza del té que puedes obtener de sus hojas. Y por si fuera poco, esta poderosa fruta puede controlar tu apetito de tal manera que empezarás a bajar de peso al consumirla. Tiene vitaminas, proteínas y minerales que te darán energía, pero su alto contenido en fibra hará que te sientas lleno por más tiempo y no te excedas al comer. \nNúmero 2. Protege tu vista\nLa provitamina A que tiene la guayaba, también conocida como beta caroteno, es muy importante para tu cuerpo. Consumir esta fruta más seguido, podrá reforzar tu vista e incluso traerle beneficios a todas las terminaciones nerviosas que tu cuerpo necesita para permitir que tu vista funcione bien, al igual que todos los órganos que necesitan a tu sistema nervioso para garantizar que estos tengan su debido funcionamiento.\nNúmero 3. Cuida tu cerebro y memoria\nEn muchas partes del mundo, la guayaba es usada por su capacidad para proteger la memoria por las elevadas cantidades de vitamina A que contiene y se han hecho algunas investigaciones sobre eso. Pero lo que si está confirmado es que tomar el té de las hojas de esta fruta te ayudará a mejorar tu capacidad cerebral, ayudar a tu salud mental gracias a que alivia el estrés y la ansiedad e incluso prevenir o tratar muchas de las deficiencias cerebrales que pueden presentarse con el tiempo. Todo esto es gracias a otras propiedades de la fruta como las que protegen a tu sistema nervioso y más vitaminas que contiene como la B6 y la vitamina C. Además, un beneficio sorprendente es que las hojas de la guayaba son especiales para tratar los dolores de cabeza e incluso para tratar la resaca. Masticar sus hojas un poco podría aliviar esos malestares en la cabeza y los mareos.\nA continuación, te enseñaré cómo preparar el té de hojas de guayaba\nPara elaborar esta receta necesitaremos los siguientes ingredientes: 6 hojas secas de guayaba las cuales debes dejar a la interperie por unos días hasta que tengan una forma arrugada. Canela, que es un ingrediente opcional y por último una taza de agua. Primero debes colocar el agua en una olla que posteriormente pondrás a hervir por un minuto. Cuando termine de hervir, triturarás las hojas y las dejarás caer en el interior de la olla. Notarás que el agua de la olla va cambiando de color, cuando notes esto le pondrás la tapa a la olla y la dejarás reposar por 10 minutos. Al finalizar la espera agrega un poco de canela al gusto, esto se hace para darle un poco más de sabor al té. Por último, traslada el té de guayaba a una taza con un colador para que las hojas no permanezcan en el líquido. Sin duda algunas de las propiedades de algunos alimentos no sólo están en sus frutos, pues, como has notado en este vídeo las hojas también pueden ser bastante beneficiosas para tu salud. Sigue estos consejos, prepara tu té de guayaba y mantente saludable.\nNo olvides consultar con tu médico de confianza antes de aplicar alguno de estos consejos",

I’m from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable wit or enjoyed watching me eat interesting food like sea penis, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. \n\nBest Ever Food Review Show is the first food review show exploring the unique foods of each country with a fresh point of view and a punchy delivery, encouraging empathy and understanding of other cultures along the way. From the best street food to the most insane food markets to...well...yes, sea penis, nothing is off limits (except cucumbers. Cucumbers are off limits). \n\nI can’t wait to see where this food journey takes us. Don’t forget to subscribe, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!"

When Alice measures her height, she’s not tall enough to get on, and sadly, she is turned away. Feeling upset, Alice starts to cry.\n\nBut don’t worry! Alice’s older sister, Eva, is smart, resourceful, and always full of great ideas. She starts coming up with all sorts of creative solutions to help Alice get onto the trampoline. First, they eat healthy foods like broccoli and carrots, hoping it would help Alice grow taller. Then, they try changing their clothes to see if that helps. But no matter what they try, Alice just can’t seem to grow tall enough.\n\nIn the end, they come up with a brilliant idea and call their mom for help. What do you think happens next?

Dad is feeling the heat, and he’s in need of some serious cooling down. He calls out to his trusty little helper, Alyssa, to save the day! But instead of just bringing a regular ice pack or some cold water, Alyssa has something much more fun and magical up her sleeve. 💡\n\nAlyssa rushes off to her secret laboratory (aka her playroom!) and decides to make something super cool — ice slime! ❄️🧊 With a dash of glitter and a swirl of magical colors, Alyssa creates a slime masterpiece that looks just like ice! She mixes and stretches the slime until it’s perfect and brings it back to her dad. But instead of handing him the ice, she gently places it on his face — and the funniest thing happens! 😂 Dad’s surprised face says it all! The icy slime helps him cool off, but it’s also squishy, stretchy, and so much fun to play with. Alyssa giggles as her dad’s face melts into a smile. Mission accomplished! 🥳\n\nJust when dad thinks the surprises are over, his stomach growls. Now he’s hungry! 🍔 Dad asks Alyssa if she can help him find something to eat.

Alyssa bursts into laughter as dad realizes he’s been tricked again. What a funny and creative way to play with food!\n\nBut the fun doesn’t stop there.

Alyssa brings the cupcake to her dad, and just as he’s about to take a bite… surprise! The cupcake is filled with slime! 💦 Slime oozes out everywhere, and dad can’t believe his eyes! Alyssa’s pranks keep getting better and better. She’s full of surprises, and dad is always up for the fun!\n\nNow it’s time for the grand finale. Alyssa, being the ultimate prankster, has one last surprise for her dad. She brings out a giant watermelon 🍉 — but this is no ordinary watermelon. Hidden inside is more of Alyssa’s magical slime! When dad tries to slice the watermelon, out comes the gooey, stretchy slime! Dad’s shocked but can’t stop laughing. Even though he’s been pranked all day, he’s having the best time playing with Alyssa. Their bond is full of love, laughter, and endless creativity.\n\nAt the end of the day, what makes this video special is the love and joy between Alyssa and her dad.

Alice's excitement as she collects each toy keeps kids engaged, and her laughter makes the experience even more joyful.\n\n5. **Learning to eat**: One part of the video focuses on teaching children healthy eating habits. Alice and her dad sit down to eat together, and she learns not to be afraid of trying new foods.

Throughout the video, you’ll hear fun, catchy songs that children can sing along to. These songs are designed to make learning numbers and letters enjoyable. Children will love singing along with Alice as they learn new things through music!\n\n7. **Interactive play**: The entire video is filled with interactive moments where kids can follow along. Whether it’s counting toys, learning colors, or joining in a fun song, children are encouraged to actively participate rather than just watch.

                "title": "Fun family video: Dad and daughters ate too much, started exercising, and lost weight!",
                "description": "In this video, Dad and his two fun-loving daughters are having an amazing day! It all starts with them playing in a family video for kids, filled with laughter, joy, and fun. The girls spent the whole morning driving toy cars and playing with dolls, and of course, after all that activity, they got hungry! The younger daughter, who loves videos for kids aged 2-3, started asking, \"Mom, Mom, let's eat!\" Her older sister, who prefers videos for kids aged 3-4, joined in and eagerly supported her: \"Mom, you know I love healthy videos and healthy food!\"\n\nMom couldn’t resist for long, especially when Dad, the star of fun entertainment videos for kids, supported the girls. Mom, like a true magician, prepared a whole mountain of food — not just for the family, but for a real feast! But what happened next? Yes, they all overate! 😄 Even Dad, who is usually sporty and active (since he often appears in educational videos for kids, talking about healthy eating), couldn’t hold back and ate until he was full.\n\nAnd then, when their bellies got big and moving became impossible, Dad suggested they watch some developmental videos for kids aged 4-5 and start working out. After all, everyone knows: if you often watch videos for kids aged 6 or even videos for kids aged 7-8, you know that physical exercise is the best way to get back in shape. So, the whole family decided that exercise was the perfect solution! Dad and the girls started running around the house, doing fun exercises, and Mom even suggested recording all of it in a video for kids aged 9-10, so that everyone could see how fun and easy it is to exercise!\n\nThe younger daughter suggested training to her favorite developmental videos for kids aged 2-3, while the older one preferred videos for kids aged 3-5, with interesting dolls and fun exercises. Dad, of course, supported his daughters and said, \"Girls, exercise is fun! And if we want to get back in shape, we need to train with our favorite videos on YouTube!\"\n\nThen the whole family came up with fun exercises involving toy cars, like in videos for boys with cars, and games with dolls, like in videos for girls with dolls. They jumped, ran, and laughed — and all of it reminded them of their favorite fun developmental videos for kids. Of course, this all happened to the music from their favorite videos for kids aged 6, which added even more fun to their workout.\n\nIn the end, they did so many exercises that their bellies returned to normal, and Dad and the girls happily said, \"Now we are ready to film another family video for everyone looking for fun kids' entertainment videos and who wants to spend the day as actively and joyfully as we did!\"\n\nOur advice: If you want to stay healthy and active, like the heroes of this video, don't forget to exercise and eat the right food. Exercise can be fun, especially if you watch educational videos for kids, where they teach you how to exercise properly and eat healthy food. Because exercise not only makes us stronger but also happier! 😄 And remember, you can always find inspiration in developmental videos for kids to have a fun and active time!\n\n#aliceanddad #aliceandeva #cartoon #amusementpark\n\nOn our Ya - Alisa channel, we create funny videos for kids, where Alisa and her family engage in a variety of kids entertainment.

                "description": "Welcome to our family channel, where fun and learning for kids go hand in hand! 🌟 Each of our videos is an opportunity to explore a new world filled with unexpected adventures and valuable life lessons. In today’s video, Dad and his energetic daughter Alice embark on a fun culinary adventure that begins with play and ends with laughter and joy! 🎉\n\nLike many kids, Alice loves to use her imagination and play with toy food. Instead of real cooking, she offers her dad imaginary dishes, sparking a playful adventure full of giggles. Dad, always ready to support his daughter, eagerly dives into her world, where anything can be part of a delightful cooking show. The two share not just food but a fun and memorable experience that strengthens their bond and fills their home with joy.\n\n👨‍👧 In this video, you’ll see:\n\nHow Alice uses her creativity to offer her dad imaginative solutions, developing her problem-solving skills and learning through play.\nA dad who supports his daughter in every way, showing the importance of patience, attention, and love in raising children.\nMany funny and touching moments that will remind everyone how important it is to spend time with loved ones, joining in their games and fantasies.\nThis video is perfect for parents and kids alike because it shows how you can learn and have fun at the same time. Through play, Alice is learning important life skills—she’s developing her language, motor skills, and imagination. While she’s having fun with pretend food, she’s also picking up concepts of cooking and collaboration in her own unique way. And her dad shows us all how crucial it is to be part of a child’s world, supporting their interests and helping them explore new aspects of life.\n\n🔍 Lessons kids can learn from this video:\n\nThe importance of creativity and imagination. Through play, children learn how to solve problems, invent new ideas, and turn them into reality. Alice, creating her own “cooking show,” demonstrates that imagination is an essential part of any learning process. She turns everyday objects into something extraordinary.\nThe value of family and interaction. Dad and Alice demonstrate how shared play and spending time with loved ones can strengthen family bonds. This teaches us the importance of listening to each other, being patient, and showing respect. Family time, no matter how simple, becomes precious.\nLearning through play. Many skills, like concentration, coordination, and communication, can be developed through simple games. Alice is not only learning to have fun but also engaging with her dad, making the learning process both enjoyable and meaningful.\nBesides their fun with toy food, this episode also highlights another important value—spending quality time together. As we all know, the most memorable moments in life aren’t always the big celebrations or vacations, but rather the times we spend laughing, playing, and learning together with the people we love. Simple moments of connection, like the ones shared in this video, can lead to the strongest memories and the best life lessons.\n\n👨‍👧 Heartwarming moments:\n\nOne of the funniest moments in the video is when Dad tries to lie down and rest after all the excitement, but Alice, with her playful energy, quickly steals the pillow from under his head! This scene will make anyone who has ever played with small children smile, as it perfectly captures the unpredictability and joy they bring into our lives.\nAnother hilarious scene unfolds when Dad catches a chocolate fish in the pool. But Alice, always full of surprises, finds a dried fish from her cat’s bowl and suggests a trade. This moment is full of laughter, as Dad has to decide whether to stick with the chocolate fish or go for the real one!\nBut what’s most important is that in every video, we don’t just play—we also aim to share essential values like love, mutual respect, cooperation, and the joy of learning something new. Children learn not just through books and lessons but through the daily moments they share with their families. This video is all about those everyday moments that shape us and teach us the most valuable lessons in life.\n\n🎯 What we teach on our channel:\n\nImagination without limits. We show kids that they can invent many amazing stories and games using the simple things around them. Even toy food or a poolside game can turn into an exciting adventure! We encourage creativity and problem-solving in a fun, lighthearted way.\nFamily values. We always emphasize the importance of family. Support, love, and spending time together are what bring us closer and help each family member feel important and valued. Family time is about making memories, building trust, and fostering lifelong bonds.\n\n\n #aliceanddad #aliceandeva #cartooncartoon  #amusementparkrides",

When I was growing up, dealing with the craziness at home, the internet is where I went to truly be me and express myself. I'm sorry I abandoned those who lifted me up in the first place, and I'm sorry I lost myself, thank you for lifting me again now, even when I was in my darkest moments of my life, I'll continue to try to better myself, and become someone I'm proud of, rather than feeling like a nobody. Sometimes I forget people actually look up to me, because I find myself becoming my own worst enemy when I get in my head to much. I've been away too long, I'm ready to get to know everyone again. Thank you all for reading. - Adam Dahlberg 2018\n\nNobodies are those always on the path to be somebody everyday. \n#Nobodies",

So I reached out to the USMC and asked if I could attend the school and film the experience and they said \"Yes\". Prior to arriving to Okinawa I knew Very Very little about what actually happens at the USMC Jungle Survival school and boy was I in for a surprise. \n\nI was attached with their leadership course, a more rigorous course for team and squad level leaders. Its a 5 week course that teaches repelling and crossing extreme terrain, how to treat and evacuate casualties in the jungle and spends a lot of time on jungle tactics. The fourth week of the training is all about survival in jungle environment. So I joined about 30 marines for survival school portion of their training. \n\nFor survival week, we were not allowed to bring food, caffeine, nicotine tabaco, spare cloths, tents, sleeping bag and most every creature comfort you would want in the jungle. There were 6 items we were allowed and a few items like tarps were we allowed only 1 per team. \n\nI was deeply impressed by the all the students and instructors I met during my week with the USMC and am really grateful that I got to spend a week with them. \n\nFor more information about the the US Marine Corps Jungle Survival School and the 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa check out:\n\nUSMC 3D Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/3dmardiv?igsh=YnRjYzEzNTd0dzNl\n\nUSMC 3D Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/3dMarineDivision\n\nUSMC 3D Twitter/X:\nhttps://x.com/3d_marine_div?s=21&t=n1m2Cjqfd_3Kh2WU6P8Odw\n\nCheck out our social media pages here:\nOutdoor Boys on FACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys\n\nOutdoor Boys on INSTAGRAM\n@outdoorboyschannel\n\nBUY OUTDOOR BOYS T-SHIRTS\n http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/",
