                "description": "Salt has been used for centuries as a natural remedy to help clear mucus and congestion from the sinuses, throat, chest, and lungs. Its powerful effects stem from its ability to draw out excess moisture and reduce inflammation, making it easier for your body to expel trapped mucus. When salt is used in a saline solution or as part of steam inhalation, it can help break down thick mucus, clearing clogged nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure. Gargling with warm salt water can soothe the throat, loosen phlegm, and reduce irritation, while salt therapy, such as inhaling fine salt particles in a controlled environment, can benefit the lungs by improving airway function and reducing mucus buildup. Whether you’re dealing with seasonal allergies, a lingering cold, or chronic respiratory issues, salt can offer a simple, effective, and natural way to breathe easier and feel better.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "Cloves are a powerful natural remedy that can significantly improve respiratory health, offering numerous benefits for the sinuses, chest, and lungs. Packed with eugenol, an essential compound known for its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, cloves can help dissolve mucus, clear airways, and reduce congestion. By loosening phlegm and breaking down mucus build-up, they support easier breathing and promote sinus and lung health. The warming properties of cloves also soothe irritated tissues, making them an excellent remedy for respiratory discomfort caused by colds, coughs, or allergies. Whether chewed or brewed into a soothing tea, cloves can help protect the respiratory system from infections and provide relief from chronic issues like sinusitis or bronchitis. Their potent antioxidant content also supports the immune system, further enhancing the body’s ability to fight off respiratory ailments. Incorporating cloves into your routine is a simple yet powerful way to maintain happy sinuses, a healthy chest, and strong lungs.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "Incorporating facial exercises and lymphatic massage 3-4 times weekly can significantly transform the health and appearance of your skin. These techniques work by stimulating fibroblasts in the dermis, the second layer of your skin, to boost the natural production of collagen and elastin—two vital proteins responsible for skin firmness, elasticity, and a youthful glow. As you activate these cells through targeted movements and gentle massage, you not only enhance the skin's resilience against fine lines and wrinkles but also promote better blood flow and lymphatic drainage. This helps to flush out toxins, reduce puffiness, and revitalize your complexion. The result? Smoother, more radiant, and wrinkle-free skin that looks naturally healthy and rejuvenated. Take control of your skincare from within and unlock the potential for glowing, youthful skin with these simple yet effective techniques!\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

They help reduce triglycerides, lower blood pressure, and decrease inflammation, all of which are critical for maintaining healthy arteries and preventing heart attacks. Omega-3s also improve the elasticity of blood vessels and reduce the formation of plaque, promoting better blood flow and reducing the risk of clots.\nTiming plays a role in maximizing the absorption and effectiveness of omega-3s. Since they are fat-soluble, taking them with a meal containing healthy fats enhances absorption. Additionally, regular supplementation helps maintain consistent levels in the body, providing ongoing cardiovascular benefits.\nIncluding omega-3s as part of a heart-healthy lifestyle supports artery health, helping to reduce the risk of heart-related issues over time.\n\n***********************************************\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "Dates can support weight management and help reduce belly fat when consumed in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. Here's how they may help:\n\nNatural Sweetener & Fiber: Dates are a great source of dietary fiber, which helps to improve digestion and can reduce cravings by making you feel fuller longer. This can help with managing calorie intake, which is key for weight loss.\n\nNatural Sugar Boost: The natural sugars in dates can provide a quick energy boost, which can be especially useful before a workout, helping to increase calorie burn during exercise.\n\nSupports Digestive Health: Fiber in dates helps regulate digestion, which can prevent bloating and support a flatter stomach.\n\nHowever, dates are also calorie-dense, so consuming them in moderation is important for those aiming to lose weight. Eating 1-2 dates as a snack or adding them to smoothies or oatmeal can be a great way to incorporate their benefits without going overboard.\n\nDates can play a role in helping to control blood sugar and insulin levels, though moderation is key because they are a high-sugar fruit. Here's how dates may influence blood sugar and insulin:\n\nLow Glycemic Index (GI): Dates, despite their sweetness, have a relatively low glycemic index, which means they cause a slower and more gradual increase in blood sugar levels compared to foods with a high GI, like white bread or sugary snacks. This slower release of glucose helps in avoiding spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, making dates a more stable energy source.\n\nHigh Fiber Content: Dates are rich in fiber, particularly soluble fiber, which slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates. This delayed digestion helps prevent sudden increases in blood sugar after eating. Fiber also promotes a feeling of fullness, which can help with appetite control and prevent overeating.\n\nNatural Sugars: The sugars in dates are natural fructose and glucose, which may cause fewer blood sugar fluctuations compared to refined sugars. Additionally, the presence of other beneficial compounds in dates, such as antioxidants, can support insulin sensitivity.\n\nMicronutrients Support Metabolism: Dates contain various vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium, which plays a role in blood sugar regulation. Magnesium helps improve insulin sensitivity, making cells more responsive to insulin and helping in effective blood sugar control.\n\nAntioxidants and Anti-inflammatory Properties: Dates are packed with antioxidants, such as flavonoids and carotenoids, which help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. Reducing inflammation may improve insulin sensitivity over time, making it easier for the body to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nIncorporating dates in small amounts as part of a balanced diet can offer these benefits without causing large blood sugar spikes. However, since they are calorie-dense, it’s best to consume them in moderation, especially for people who need to carefully monitor their blood sugar.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "Lemons are a powerhouse of nutrients and have numerous benefits for the body, making them an essential addition to your diet. Packed with Vitamin C, lemons boost your immune system, help fight off colds and flu, and promote healthy skin by aiding collagen production. The high antioxidant content combats harmful free radicals, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Lemons also support digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and acting as a natural detoxifier, flushing out toxins from your body.  They increase peristalsis in the intestines helping to eliminate wastes and reversing constipation.  Their alkalizing properties balance pH levels, which can reduce inflammation and improve overall health. Additionally, lemons contain pectin fiber, which aids in weight management by promoting a feeling of fullness. They also provide essential minerals such as potassium, which supports heart health by regulating blood pressure. With their hydrating qualities, lemons ensure that your body stays well-hydrated and energized. Overall, incorporating lemons into your diet can lead to better hydration, improved digestion, enhanced immunity, clearer skin, and a healthier heart, making them an incredibly beneficial fruit for your wellness journey.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "Freezing blueberries can actually boost their health benefits, making them even more of a superfood. When blueberries are frozen, their cell walls break down slightly, allowing for a higher concentration of anthocyanins to be released. Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants responsible for the deep blue and purple colors in blueberries, and they play a crucial role in reducing inflammation, improving blood flow, and protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Studies suggest that these antioxidants may contribute to improved brain function, enhanced memory, and reduced risk of cognitive decline as we age. They also support heart health by helping to lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels. Additionally, anthocyanins have been linked to cancer-fighting properties, as they can inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells and support immune system function. Freezing blueberries, then, not only preserves their nutrients but may enhance their ability to deliver these protective benefits, making them a simple yet potent addition to a daily diet.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

Your body uses water in all its cells, organs, and tissues to help regulate its temperature and maintain other bodily functions. Because your body loses water through breathing, sweating, and digestion, it's important to rehydrate by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. The amount of water you need depends on a variety of factors, including the climate you live in, how physically active you are, and whether you're experiencing an illness or have any other health problems.\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

                "description": "The benefits of eating Carotenoid Antioxidants reduce the risks of cancer, better heart and artery health, improves eye health, strengthens immune system, and lowers inflammation throughout the body.  Carotenoids reduces oxidative stress and free radicals, protecting the cells in the body.  \n\nClogged arteries result from the build-up of a substance called plaque in the arterial walls. It is also medically referred to as arterial plaque. This plaque can reduce blood flow or even block it altogether.\nClogged arteries increase your risk of developing other health complications like a heart attack or stroke.  \nSome of the most common risk factors for clogged arteries are:\nHigh levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol)\nA high blood pressure\nSmoking tobacco\nDiabetes or elevated blood sugar levels\nA family history of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries\nStress\nObesity\nA sedentary lifestyle\n\nMost cases of clogged arteries do not exhibit any symptoms until a heart attack or blood clot presents itself. However, in cases where 70% or more of the arteries are blocked, you will notice the following symptoms.\nSevere cases of clogged arteries may exhibit symptoms like:\nShortness of breath\nSweating\nNausea\nChest pain or angina\nPalpitations of the heart\nDizziness\nWeakness\n\nPlease subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family.

The pituitary gland is often called the “master gland” because its hormones control other parts of the endocrine system, controlling many organs in the body.

So, here you'll be either on a mat or on the floor on all fours.  You're going to make sure that your shoulders are aligned with your wrists.  They're out of the ears, not all crunched up and we're going to start off with one leg.  You're going to keep the foot flexed, the knee bent at 90 degrees.  You're going to think about pressing that heel up to the ceiling.  So, you can take it down and then press it straight up.  Really squeeze your butt.  Press that heel up as high as you can, almost think about putting your footprint on the ceiling.  So, you take it down and up, down and up. \n\nReally make sure here that your abs stay engaged.  They stay nice and tight.  Think about the belly button being pulled to the spine to prevent injury.  If you don't, you're going to start arching that back and you can throw your back out if you're doing the exercise like that.  So really make sure the abs are nice and tight.  \n\nYou take that knee down and then push it straight up, footprint on the ceiling.  Same thing, other side.  Foot is flexed.  Take it up.  Down.  Up.  Down.  So you can do about 10 to 12 on each side.  Switch it up.  However many you're feeling.  You're going to feel this from the first few because it's really going to focus on isolating each glute.  So, also, you want to make sure that your body weight stays on the side that you're working. So if you're working your right side, you're going to focus on keeping that body weight on the right side.  When you get tired, you tend to shift your body to the other side and that loses the tension in that glute that you're working.  So, a tip I usually give is to bring both hands together on whichever side you're working and really focus that tension on that glute that you're working.  And that's how you do a glute kickback with a bent knee.",

                "description": "Check out these helpful kitchen tools for mixing dough!\n\n5.5-Quart Stand Mixer:\n🔗https://amzn.to/3Kc6bvC\n12inch Stainless Steel Whisk:\n🔗https://amzn.to/3DuWWnW\nBamboo Cutting Board for Kitchen:\n🔗https://amzn.to/3NHoUSc\nMixing Bowls with Airtight Lids:\n🔗https://amzn.to/3JTkNjz\nFood Kitchen Scale:\n🔗https://amzn.to/3wXqg5q\n\n\nWatch more How to Make Bread videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/511014-How-to-Mix-Dough-without-a-Mixer-Make-Bread\n\n\n\nI want to give you some tips on how to make bread dough at home without a mixer because you certainly don't need a mixer to make dough. In fact, my preference is usually to not use a mixer at home, because the mixers that you use at home have such a smaller motor compared to a professional kitchen, that it just makes more sense to me to knead everything by hand. \n\nBut you shouldn't be afraid to knead it by hand, if a recipe calls for mixing it in a mixer. If anything, you're getting back to a more traditional way of mixing, that's actually gentler on the dough and produces a more moist crumb. Mixing it in a mixer just is a way of developing the dough and you can do that with your hands. \n\nAnd so, any time you come across a bread recipe there are usually two types of mixing steps. The first is incorporating all of the ingredients and normally you would do that on low speed on your mixer. And then the second step is developing the gluten and mixing on a high speed in your mixer. And so if you're going to do this at home, the first step is to just incorporate all of the ingredients and stir it and combine all of the ingredients with your hands. \n\nIt's okay if your hands get sticky and they will get sticky, because the gluten hasn't developed yet. And I often like to use some type of plastic dough scraper to sort of keep the dough going, even though my hands are sticky. Once you have the sticky dough incorporated the next thing you want to do is to develop the gluten, and that's where you take the dough out of the bowl that you're using, and put it on a flour-dusted surface and start to knead it.\n\nReally, when you're kneading it you're just working the gluten. The more strength you can use with your arms and with your body, the faster you can develop that gluten in the dough, if the recipe is calling for kneading and developing. And then after you knead it, you start to do a window pane test and you check to see, how has my gluten developed? And so once you have your gluten developed and it passes the window pane test, then you can put your dough aside and let it ferment, and that's very, very similar to kneading it with a mixer.",

When that happens, my main recommendation to them is that they come in and they see an addiction specialist to be evaluated. But I often get calls from people who aren't in my local area and may not have access to a medical professional. In that case, there are two ways of minimizing the problems that may be associated with alcohol withdrawal. \n\nThe main one, if you can see a physician, is to do so and you can be prescribed different medications that will be prescribed over the course, of usually 4-7 days that each day, the dose is lowered, until you're off the medication and then you'll be safe. And you'll be secure that you're not going to experience withdrawal symptoms. At least in it, you're certainly not going to experience any withdrawal symptoms that might be medically dangerous. When I say that, even when one gets off it, they may still experience some anxiety. \n\nHowever, if people do not have access to a medical professional for whatever reason, then the way to withdraw from alcohol, is to taper down the amount of alcohol that you are drinking. So if you're drinking extremely heavily, you may want to, over the course of . . . depending on how much you're drinking, it may be over the course of a few days. It may be over the course of a few weeks. Each day, reduce the amount of alcohol that you're drinking and keep tapering it down until you're not drinking at all. By doing so, you will not necessarily have any withdrawal symptoms. If you don't do that, it's very dangerous and sometimes it seems like counter-intuitive, that you want to stop drinking, that well, I should just stop drinking. But in fact, I never want people to do that because that can be medically dangerous. \n\nSo again, you want to, each day, reduce the amount you're drinking until you've stopped, or get medication from a physician, which you taper down until that stops. And then you'll be safe and secure. So those are the two techniques that you can use to stop drinking and avoid any withdrawal symptoms.",

First of all you want to make sure that you limit the child's drinks after dinner time, especially in the evening. If they need a sip of water when they are brushing their teeth, that's fine but they shouldn't have any more to drink after dinner.  Also make sure your child fully empties her bladder before she goes to bed.  If your child tends to have a small bladder or it seems like your child can't hold it all night long, then you can consider waking her up in the middle of the night.  For instance, if she goes to bed at 7:00 and you go to bed at 11:00, you could consider getting her up and having her to go pee and then having her go right back to bed. \n\nYou can also provide a small lantern or flashlight in case she is scared of the dark then she can use that to get herself to the potty or you can put a training potty next to her bed so she doesn't have to leave the room. Either way if your child has night time accidents, it is important not to get frustrated or angry. It's is okay if they have accidents and you want to make it the natural consequence if they have an accident, they need to help out the cleanup process. You can make them responsible for putting the wet sheets in the washing machine and the wet clothes in the washing machine and you can have them independently re-dress themselves.\n\nIf your child is having nighttime accidents, you do not want to put diaper on that child unless it is over their underwear. It is really important that once you start potty training, that the child never feels a diaper against her skin. So if you are concerned about an accident, she can wear her underwear to bed but put a diaper over the underwear. Lastly you can encourage your child to stay dry all night long by giving her a motivation to stay dry.  Guess what if you wake up with dry pants, then you can have ice cream for breakfast. That would help night time accidents.",

Today we're talking about the rule of thirds, when to follow it, and how to break it. As you can see here on the monitor we have got a grid that you've probably seen before if you're playing with your point-and-click or you're playing with the display settings on your camera. You are able to turn the grid on in your LCD monitor. I'd rather people not get in the habit of using their LCD monitor but start imagining that grid every time their taking a photo. As you can see we've divided our frame into nine equal boxes with two vertical lines and two horizontal lines. \n\nThat's leaving us with these four intersecting points along the frame. When we're photographing we want to put our focal point in one of these four intersecting points. It is important that we do work left to right and top to bottom. So one, two, three, four. By prioritizing our focal point in these areas our image is going to make a little bit more sense. The way I like to describe the rule of thirds is writing on a notepad and using the lines. You don't write over the lines you write on top of the lines. Where you place the words on the notepad is going to make a lot more sense and it's the same with, say, letters forming a word, words forming a sentence, and the sentence making sense. For example, if you were reading The Cat in the Hat; \"The cat in the hat makes sense,\" reading it backwards, \"hat the in cat the,\" not so much. \n\nIf we place our focal point or we don't use the rule of thirds effectively it's like mixing those words around or, even worse, reading it completely backwards which would be, \"tah eht ni tac eht.\" What I like to do is put my horizon on one of the horizontal thirds. So many people I see or so many photographs I see are putting their horizon halfway through their frame. By using the horizontal lines a little bit more effectively we're nicely spacing out that image. By placing our focal point on one of these intersecting points we're giving the focal point a little bit more prominence. We're giving a bit more depth. We're giving it a bit more relationship with the image. And using the lines, everything else in my image I like to try and have running along the lines wherever possible. I also like to divide my image into two-thirds/one-third, that's two-thirds of information and one-third of negative space or just a little bit of clarity. And of course, foreground, mid-ground, and background, but that's a bit more for landscapes. It's not important to use absolutely every single point in the rule of thirds, however the more you use, generally the more effective your photograph. Let's have a look at an example. So here's a photograph I took in Machu Picchu in Peru and, as you can see, I've pretty much used as many of those points as possible. We have the llamas in the foreground, we have the ruin in the mid-ground, and we have the mountain and the sky in the background. I've got two-thirds of positive space with everything going on and one-third of negative space with the sky. You'll notice that my two-third line, my top horizontal line is also cutting off accordingly with the mountain coming down one vertical third and the ruin coming down another vertical third. The ruin was my focal point so I used the second of the one, two, three, four focal points, or those intersections, to take this photograph. So that's how I effectively use the rule of thirds to take a photograph, and let's just talk a bit about breaking them. \n\nThis is a very controversial point with a lot of photographers. Many photographers can't stand the idea of the rule of thirds being broken. However, like most rules, it's made to be broken some of the time, but understand why you're breaking it. If you decide, \"oh, I just want to put something in the center or I just want to move a little bit,\" it's going to look sloppy, it's going to look like a bad photograph. It's not going to mak",

                "description": "Watch more Cake Decorating Tips and Tricks from CakeMade videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/517442-How-to-Make-Flowers-Food-Safe\n\nLearn how to decorate a cake with real flowers while keeping the cake food safe, courtesy of cake artist Liz Marek. Check out Liz's course Rustic Wedding Cake Trends on CakeMade.com: http://bit.ly/1upK3jK\n\n\nHow to Make Flowers Food Safe\n\nHi I'm Liz Marek and I'm teaching a new cake course called Rustic Wedding Cakes on Cake Made. It's going to awesome. I'm going to show you how to make this beautiful rustic birch log cakes super-hot design. I'm going to show you how to make the cake board, stack the cake, decorate all the tiers. We're going to be making wafer paper flowers. We're going to be making owl toppers. It's going to be awesome. I'm also going to show you how to make a really trendy cake called, The Chalkboard Cake design. You definitely want to see that one. But first, I want to show you how to make fresh flowers, food safe. This is a big deal when you're making a cake with fresh flowers. You want to prepare them in a very special way so that nobody has to worry about any sort of chemicals or yuckiness inside their cake. To prepare your rose, we're going to peel off the extra leaves, break it off or you can cut it. I think I'm just going to insert this right on the side so it looks like it's peeking out from between the two tiers. And I want to include a little bit of foliage, so I'm going to take a couple of our leaves and I'm just hold that together at the base. And we're going to take a little bit of our floral tape, give it a stretch and just wrap that around the base of your leaves. And that just to hold the leaves together at this point. And then we're going to put our flower. It's like you're kind of creating a very large buttoner. And they we're going to take another piece of floral tape, give it a stretch, and wrap that around until you cover up the ends of the flowers completely. If you need another piece of floral tape, by all means, you can use another one and layer it up. Just make sure that the bottom of the flowers are completely covered. And what that does is, that actually just stops any sort of water that is inside the flower from leaking out. And that does two things, it keeps the flower fresher for longer and it also keeps any of that water from getting into your cake which could have pesticides in it. It could have any kind of chemicals, stuff you don't really want to be eating, but it's important to keep the flower nice and fresh. \n\nSo now it's time to insert our floral arrangement into our bubble tea straw. Just guage about how long you need it to be. You want to have a good, one inch, past the end of your stem just so there's no chance of that digging into your cake and cut that off. And you can see why we need to use the bigger bubble tea straw, so you have enough space for all of this floral. Stick that in there and then I'm just going to place this right in here. Making sure I don't squish my cake. I'm going to use my scissors to sort of reach in here and push it down a little bit further. You could also use wire cutters or pliers or something like that, if you need to reach in there. So now, I'm going to put in a few other little flowers and filler leaves and things like that to fill out this bottom space. Whenever you're creating a floral arrangement, you want to think about your symmetry and you don't want to overwhelm your cake design with flowers, But you usually use one or two flowers, maybe three, if you have enough space. Usually, in this kind of design, you want to go with uneven numbers because we're not really going for super symmetrical. Break off this flower. It'd be really cool to be cutting into your wedding cake and you can smell beautiful roses and vanilla. It's pulling all the way around. Another piece of floral tape. Whenever you're creating these floral design, be sure you always have something to use as filler. If you just have big fat flowers, you're going to end up having these holes that you can't really fill and that can really create a problem in your design. So make sure you have some leaves or some other little tiny flower buds and things like that to use as part of the design. Let's put that right in here. Push that way down in there. \n\nSo as you can see, making our fresh flowers food safe is not too difficult at all. It's just mostly using your floral tape to wrap everything together and then using some bubble tea straws to insert them into the cake. I doesn't take much time and all and looks really great. Okay, so I filled in all of our little crevices and holes with foliage and other little flowers so that you don't have any sort of visuals of the support structures. So that's basically what we were doing with all the filler flowers. I've got my",

So once you find a screen that you want to take a screen shot of you are going to hold down shift, command, and the number 3. So you just go 1, 2, 3 and then it takes a screen shot of the entire screen. \n\nSo if we go to the file up here where it places it on the desktop you can open it and you'll see that we have the whole screen there. Now sometimes you just want a portion of the screen so to do that you'll go shift, command, and the number 4. So the same way as before shift, command, 4, and now you have a little cross hairs on your screen. So I just want the frog in the middle, so I'm going to draw a box around him and when I let go it takes the picture of that part so now when I open that file I see just the picture of the frog there. So there you go, that's how you take a screen shot on your Mac.",

I've been in private practice both in Maryland and consequently back in New York for the last 17 years. My office website is www.greenestreetdental.com, that's green with an \"e\" at the end, and today I'm going to be talking about teeth and dentistry.  \r\n\r\nIf your teeth are crowded, miss aligned or have uneven worn edges you have several options at your disposal. The simplest approach for slightly worn or uneven edges is to have your dentist recontour or modify these edges or actually air composite bonding or tooth colored filling to reshape the teeth. If this is not enough traditional orthodontics may be necessary. This includes something called clear tray or Invisalign braces which will move your teeth with a tray that you take in or out over the course of anywhere to 9 months to 18 months or more traditional orthodontics. This includes bonding a bracket to each and every tooth to be moved or a band and attaching a wire. Over the course of several months to potentially years, your dentist will readjust constantly straightening your teeth. This may improve your overall health, certainly will improve your aesthetic, and will improve your chewing efficiency.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/AcksI8y00k4\n▶️ https://youtu.be/OusJVh25mcI\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Shake and strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with a lime wheel.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\nThe Cosmopolitan is the only classic cocktail that was invented in the last 20 years, but it has suffered a little bit of a negative connotation lately, and I think that's due to a certain HBO show about four women going to brunch. But I'm going to go out on limb and defend the Cosmopolitan, because I think it is a great cocktail, and I have to give it serious props because without the Cosmopolitan getting so popular, who knows if cocktail culture would have reemerged the way it has in the first place. So we have to pay our respects to the Cosmopolitan. And the good news is when it's made properly with fresh ingredients it's actually a really delicious cocktail. \n\nSo we're going to start with two ounces of lemon vodka or citrus vodka, and a little orange liquer, Quantro is a great option for that, three-quarters of an ounce. You'll see a lot of versions of this recipe. This is the one I like to do, I'm kind of do a mixture of all of them. I also like to add a little bit of simple syrup, because I think that Quantro comes on a little too strong, so just a quarter ounce of simple syrup, and about three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lime juice. This is another one of those drinks is that if you get the mix or anything like that it's all downhill from there.\n\nIt's got to be fresh ingredients if it's going to taste good, and you want your drinks to taste good, right? I mean why else are you making them? And the key ingredient, of course, is the cranberry juice to give it that nice trademark pink color, three-quarters of an ounce of cranberry juice. Notice this is the real cranberry juice, not the processed kind that you usually see. This is a shaken drink, since we've got some citrus in there, a little more ice. Okay, now we've got our ice in there, and I'm going to grab the frozen coupe glass in the freezer. Okay, time to shake. Oh yeah, it's definitely pink. I mean that is a Cosmopolitan right there. I'm going to garnish it with a lime wheel, a nice, thin slice of lime to top it off. Cheers, girls. That's how you make a classic Cosmopolitan.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/q-gYcvipozY\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ofwTyfKo8Mg\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Top with Ginger Beer. Pour into highball glass. Garnish with lime wedge.\n\nWe all wish that we can be in Bermuda all the time. But for most of us it's just not possible. However, it is possible to drink like we're in Bermuda and to do that you want to be drinking a Dark and Stormy. Really simple to make, it follows the basic principles of a normal highball, like a gin and tonic or rum and Coke. \n\nBut instead of gin or white rum, we're going to use Gosling's Black Seal Rum. It is the official, actually, the legal cocktail of the Dark and Stormy, so technically it's illegal to make a Dark and Stormy without it, but I won't tell anyone. Just a really nice, full bodied, aged rum will do. However, Gosling's makes an amazing Dark and Stormy. \n\nSo just two ounces of that straight into your highball glass. And now we're going to top this off with ginger beer. Not ginger ale. Ginger ale as we know, is that sort of sweet ginger soda. This is a lot spicier and it really has a strong, fresh, ginger note to it. You'll definitely be able to tell the difference between ginger beer and ginger ale. I should note that there's no alcohol in ginger beer. So you could just drink it by itself and it'll have no alcoholic content. That's what the rum is for. \n\nWe're going to top this off with ice and put in our ginger beer. Like a lot of highballs, we're going to want to garnish this with a lime just to give it that nice, tart, tropical zing. I like to squeeze this lime in there, and then just to make it look perfect, put another one right on top. Get in there. There you go and there you are. A classic drink from Bermuda. The Dark and Stormy.\n\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/MDXaWlGyvV4\n▶️ https://youtu.be/8RoZsDiAoMY\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Muddle limes and sugar. Add Cachaca. Shake with ice and pour into rocks glass.\n\nThe classic Brazilian drink the Caipirinha has a lot in common with the Daiquiri. It has pretty much all the same ingredients, it's just mainly the methodology that's different. So here's how it differs. Instead of juicing the lime the way we do with the Daiquiri, we're actually going to muddle the whole lime wedge in there. \n\nSo I'm going to do about half a lime. I'm going to cut it into three wedges. The reason we're muddling it is that it's going to give us this really bright, fresh lime flavor that's going to come from the peel of the lime, muddling that in, and it makes a huge difference. Instead of using simple syrup we're going to use raw sugar, because we're going to grind those two together. \n\nThis is a case where you can really get into it with the muddling. The sugar and the lime are going to combine and that'll take your place of simple syrup. I'm going to do two, because this is a pretty small spoon, two spoonfuls of sugar. As always when adding sugar and citrus, feel free to tweak the balance here and there. It's all about personal preference. \n\nOkay, so now I'm going to muddle these two together. Like I said, you really want to make sure you get all that lime juice out. However, don't go too crazy, because if you kill the peel it's going to get very bitter. So yes, you can muddle it hard, but you know don't really work those guns to their fullest capabilities.\n\nAll right, now we're going to use two ounces of Cachaca. Cachaca is Brazilian rum, essentially. It's made in Brazil and unlike most rums, in Brazil they make their rum by distilling cane juice as opposed to molasses, which is how they do most rum. So it has a more vegetal than that really sort of sugary vanilla quality that rum can have and it has a little bit of a funk to it, which makes this drink really cool, especially with that brightness from the lime peel. \n\nAll right, let's get out ice. Now we are going to shake this drink, but we're not going to strain onto fresh ice the way we do most drinks. The reason is is that you want those lime wedges to be in there, so that they create this really cool aesthetic effect, and they'll still be imparting flavor even after you've muddled it and everything. \n\nIt's still going to bring about that brightness that you really want. Okay, let's grab out glass. The ever important frozen rocks glass and I like to shake this drink, but not too hard, because you don't want to break the ice up too much, because you're going to pour it right into the glass. So more of an easy shake instead of that really hard one that you usually do, but still keep the rhythm, of course. And pop the seal, and just pour it right in there, and let's top it off with a few more ice cubes. And that is how you make a caipirinha.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/vBmTVU54F0g\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3xFDbSgFPw0\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Stir and serve on the rocks with an orange twist.\n\nA Negroni is a great option for a cocktail before a really big meal. It comes from the Latin word which means to open. So it's really something to stimulate the appetite. It comes from Italy and it utilizes Campari as one of its major ingredients, which is a bitter liqueur. So I'll get to that in a minute. I'm going to start with one and a half ounces of gin. I like to use a little more gin than in some recipes. Sometimes you see one ounce of gin. I really like that juniper flavor to punch through there.\n\nNow we're going to use sweet vermouth, a whole ounce of sweet vermouth. Then one ounce of Campari. A whole ounce of Campari sounds like a lot. If you've ever tasted it it is pretty bitter, but somehow the gin, vermouth and campari, just create something that is so much greater than the sum of its parts. Every time I make one I feel like it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it is a really extraordinary drink.\n\nAnd bitterness in cocktails is something that's really, really great. In food it's often thought of as a negative thing. You don't want something to be too bitter, but in drinks it's very applicable and much more pleasant. So if you're nervous about something being bitter, because you've had a bad experience, say like bitter chocolate or something, try a Negroni and I think you'll be surprised.\n\nSo we're going to add some ice. We're going to stir this because it's all alcoholic ingredients. No need to shake anything. And I'm going to serve this on the rocks. I think that extra dilution really helps bring out some of those more complex flavors from the Campari and the vermouth. Lots of spice, herbs, botanical's. \n\nYou know they used to sort of think of alcohol as having medicinal properties, especially in Italy and it really does sort of help settle your stomach. It's actually not a bad drink after your meal, too. It's a nice bookend for a really big dinner. Another really great thing about this drink is that unlike a Manhattan or a Martini, it's not as strong because the campari and the sweet vermouth are lower in alcohol. \n\nSo it's still stiff, but it doesn't quite pack the same wallop that a martini does. Okay, so let's get our frozen rocks glass from the freezer and if you can. get those ice cube trays that make the perfect cube ice. It's really great for stirred cocktails like this one. Because they're so big they don't melt quite as fast and water down your drink too much. Okay, it's so beautiful. \n\nAnd for a finishing touch we're going to garnish this with a twist of orange, just to further bring out those beautiful aromatic notes. So just squeeze the oils over the top, again with the white part of the orange peel facing you, and then squeezing the oils over the top. And that is how you make a classic Negroni.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3xFDbSgFPw0\n▶️ https://youtu.be/gXJG0N6_n_A\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on topics ranging from makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Shake and strain into a Ã‚_ sugar-rimmed glass. Garnish with orange twist.\n\nThe Sidecar is a classic cocktail that a lot of people have heard of, but few people actually know how to make, or have even tasted when made properly. The cocktail was invented in the 1920's in France. You'll notice that a lot of classic cocktails start to be invented in Europe in the 1920's. \n\nThat's because of a little thing called prohibition, which was started in 1919 in the United States, so all of the American bartenders, the ones basically who didn't go and work in underground speakeasy's or went to find another profession, they would go over to Europe and started creating drinks over there. \n\nSo the Sidecar is made with cognac, which is a French brandy made in the Cognac region of France and Cointreau which is french orange liqueur. It's a sour style cocktail and I love this drink, because I think it's still a really dignified, elegant drink, but it isn't as stiff as a Manhattan or Martini, so if you're looking for an alternative to that. But anyway, let's make a Sidecar.\n\nWe're going to start with 2 oz. of cognac. So like I said it's a French brandy. Brandy is just distilled fruit, in this case distilled wine and we know France is known for it's great wines. We're going to do a whole ounce of Cointreau. Cointreau is a orange liqueur and it's really high quality. There are other liqueur, orange liqueurs out there, they're triple secs and stuff.\n\nSome of them will work okay in a Sidecar, but I really swear by Cointreau. I just think it's the highest quality out there. One whole ounce and this is sweet, so this is going to be your sweetener. There's no simple syrup in this drink, even though it's a sour style drink. I have to a juice a little more lemon. I've got that strainer setup there, that fine strainer. \n\nThis is one of the drinks that I really like to have the pulps strained out. I think that nice texture justifies that extra step of straining out the lemon juice, but to each his own. So now we're going to do three-quarters of an ounce of lemon juice. I mentioned that Cointreau is your sweetener and there no simple. This is a tart drink, and so if you want it to be a little sweeter it's okay to add just a little simple syrup, just a dash. But I like it made this way and is the classic recipe, by the way. \n\nAll right, so we're going to shake this drink, because it's got lemon juice in it, which is a non-alcoholic ingredient. We do really need to force those ingredients together, so now we're ready to shake. First though, I'm going to prep our glass. Like I said it's a tart drink, so if you haven't added some simple syrup and are doing it the classic way, we're going to rim the glass with sugar and I'm going to show you how to do that.\n\nSo we have our glass chilling in the freezer, always a great idea for any cocktail. They'll keep it cold. We're going to set that and now we're going to shake. I'm going to be alone with my shaker for a moment, excuse me. It's hard to look cool shaking, but it is the closest you'll ever get to see me dance, which I look less cool doing. Okay, so I'm not even going to give this a second. \n\nThis was chilling in the freezer. After we take it out, we let it sit for a minute. As the glass warms up, the condensation will start to form on the rim, and you don't need to use any citrus or anything. You'll notice that it'll just stick right on there. See that? You don't have the mess from putting maybe a lemon on there to get it to stick or sometimes people use simple syrup which works, but this is a lot cleaner, a lot easier and it's a lot more even. \n\nSo this will take the edge off of that tartness from the Cointreau. And just like I strained the lemon juice, I'm also going to fine strain all the little ice bits, because I think that this is again, just such a delicate drink. Every little step you can take to make it even more delicate, I say do it. \n\nFinally, we'll add our garnish, which is a twist of orange. We're just going to express the oils on to the drink, to get those really nice, ripe aromatics from the orange peel. Hold the white part to you, the pith, and hold it kind of sideways like this and gently just squeeze out those oils over the top. Give it a nice little twist and there you have it. That is how you make the famous Sidecar.\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3xFDbSgFPw0\n▶️ https://youtu.be/gXJG0N6_n_A\n\n\n#Howcast #sidecar #cocktailrecipes \n\nRelated searches:\neasy sidecar recipe\ncocktail recipes by ingredient\npopular cocktail recipes\nwhiskey cocktail recipes\nbest cocktail recipes",

Build in Collins glass. Top with soda.\n\nA Collins is a style of cocktail that is made in, as you might imagine, a Collin's glass. I'm going to show you how to make the king of all Collin's cocktails, Tom Collin's. The Tom Collins is basically a gin sour that is topped with soda water. So we're going to start with our gin. Two ounces, as you would a normal gin sour. You notice a lot of these classic cocktails have the same recipe's just different ingredients. \n\nAnd we're just going to build this right in the glass, because we're going to top it with soda water. So we don't need to shake it or stir it to add any extra dilution from the ice. Just make sure that your soda is nice and cold, because we're not going to get any extra chilling from the ice when we shake it. Now three-quarter ounce of simple syrup as our sweetener, again just one part sugar to one part water. \n\nAnd we need some lemon juice as our citrus to balance out that sweetener, we're just going to need three-quarters ounce of that, equal parts. And as always the fresher your juice is the better. I cannot condone store bought citrus. I just can't do it and I won't. All right, fresh lemon juice, three-quarters ounce of that. This drink is really great for hot weather, because of all that soda water it's really, really refreshing. And also, it makes it last a lot longer.\n\nAnd of course, you can use three-quarters lemon. The Tom Collin's is the most classic of the Collin's, but it's a great template for variation. You could make this with bourbon. You could make this with tequila, all that stuff works. Now I'm going to top it off with ice. I really like to fill it all the way up and our nice cold seltzer. Whoop, we're good. \n\nLike I said that'll serve as our dilution. So no shaking or stirring. I think the Tom Collins is a drink that deserves a good garnish. It's a long drink. You're going to be holding it for awhile, might as well make it pretty to look at, so okay I'm just going to cut a little wedge of orange. And if you have a toothpick or a little crystal pick like this you can make what they call a flag. And add a little cherry, with a cherry on top, naturally. And then jimmy that in there, and there you go, and that's how you make a classic Collins, the Tom Collins.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/q-gYcvipozY\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ofwTyfKo8Mg\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

                "description": "How to Make Cocktails Playlist with tom Macy https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJxNvoq3gXjucZOGPf9RRfX5TqF6AHw1\n\n\nHow to Make a Whiskey Sour | Cocktail Recipes\n\nRecipe: 2 oz Rittenhouse Rye; Ã‚_ oz lemon juice; Ã‚_ oz simple syrup; 1 egg white. Shake and strain over fresh ice in a double rocks glass. Garnish with orange slice and cherry.\n\nWhiskey sour is a cocktail that does not have the greatest reputation. I think the reason for that is that sour makes people think of sour mix, which is this disgusting, processed fake ingredient. But you really shouldn't be afraid, because sour is actually just a style of cocktail. Back in the 19th century a sour just meant a drink that had a spirit, citrus and some sugar or simple syrup. That's really all a whiskey sour is, it's whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this drink is it's a great way to still have whiskey, if you really like whiskey in hot weather in the summer, because it's a really refreshing drink. So we're going to start with our spirit. Two ounces of rye whiskey, you can also use bourbon. I just love rye whiskey, let's face it. But this is also a drink that bourbon works great in too.\n\nNow we'll do equal parts sugar and citrus. Three-quarters of an ounce of simple syrup. Again that's just one part sugar to one part water dissolved together. Three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, very important. You know that's the step that people decided they didn't want to do, and so instead they created sour mix, which then made people hate the whiskey sour. So this is the most important ingredient in your whiskey sour. \n\nNow I'm going to do something else that's a very classic touch to the whiskey sour. It might scare you a little bit, but just bear with me. I'm going to add a little bit of egg white. There's alcohol in there, so whatever fears you have of raw eggs, whatever could maybe be in there, the alcohol is going to kill, so don't worry about that. What it's going to do is not really add so much in the way of taste, but it's going to add a really nice frothy texture that's going to be great. \n\nSo we're going to do the egg whites, so just separate the egg white. Here you go. Toss the rest. As always it is very handy to have a trash can nearby to make your life easier. Whenever there's a raw egg in the drink, we're going to do something called a dry shake, which means to shake it without ice first to emulsify the egg. Then we'll shake it again with ice to chill it. \n\nJust a few shakes to do that. You can see it's nice and frothy. Now we'll add our ice. Whiskey sour is a drink that you can serve on the rocks or up. I like it on the rocks, especially if you have those really nice ice cube trays that make the big 1 x 1 cubes, which I happen to have on hand. You'll see the results in a minute. \n\nJust so you can see, that ice cube is perfectly square. That means it won't melt as fast in the drink. There are only four ice cubes in there, so it won't water down your drink too fast. Okay, and now it's time to shake for real. Oh yeah, check this out. See how frothy that is? It gives it a really nice, silky texture. That's all from the egg white and again, it's not really going to add anything in the way of flavor. \n\nWe're going to garnish the whiskey sour with an orange and cherry flag. it will really liven things up. See we have a toothpick, you kind of spear it like that and then grab your cherries. One right on top and then sort of get in there, so the top is poking out. And there you have it, so no need to be afraid anymore. That is how you make a classic whiskey sour.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/q-gYcvipozY\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ofwTyfKo8Mg\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

You'll see why it's called a \"march\" in a second. So you're going to lie back. \n\nSo you're going to get into a glut bridge. I like to lift my toes, just because it takes the quads out of it. You can keep them down if you feel more stable or if you're having back problems, but I like to get as much hip extension as I can just by making sure it's coming from my hamstrings and my gluts. By lifting my toes, I'm ensuring that that's happening. So, what you're going to do from here is you're just going to bend one knee in toward your stomach and alternate. It kind of looks like I'm marching. Glut bridge march. So, the most important thing here is that you want to keep your hips up in full extension. \n\nSo if you're feeling like you're dropping a little bit, just by getting this march in, then I want you to just focus on holding a glut bridge. But the march, you're alternating and your hips are up in full extension. You could reps. You know, 15 to 20 reps. You go 3 sets and that should be enough to get your gluts and your hamstrings activated. And that's how you do a glut bridge march.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/QaaYfq7ChDs\n▶️ https://youtu.be/0FS6fpFJ3Nc\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

But I'm going to demonstrate on my back. You want  to  make  sure\nyour abs are engaged,  your back is flat against  the  floor  and  your  rib\ncage is down. Hands are going be be down by your side. Your legs  are  going\nto be bent at 90 degrees.  \n\nSo if you want to  keep  them  bent  you're  more\nthan welcome to. What you're going  to  do  is  you're  going  to  alternate\nbringing your right and your left, up and down. \n\nUp  and  down.  Now  if  you\nwant to make this harder you have a couple options. You can straighten  your\nlegs and then scissor from here which is a lot more difficult. But you  want\nto make sure your not getting so much hip flexor that it's interfering  with\nyour abs. So if you're feeling this here rather than here  then  just  bring\nyour legs up a little higher and scissor from there.  \n\nIf  you're  still  not\nfeeling like this is challenging enough go ahead  and  drop  your  legs  and\nscissor from here. But again if it's going into your hip flexors  then  just\nmake sure your legs are a little higher. You want to make sure your back  is\ncompletely flat the whole time and  your  breathing  is  in  sync  with  the\nscissoring. And that's how you do scissor lifts.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/QaaYfq7ChDs\n▶️ https://youtu.be/0FS6fpFJ3Nc\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

                "title": "How to Make a Mint Julep | Cocktail Recipes",
                "description": "How to Make Cocktails Playlist with tom Macy https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJxNvoq3gXjucZOGPf9RRfX5TqF6AHw1\n\nHow to Make a Mint Julep | Cocktail Recipes\n\nMuddle 8-10 mint leaves in .5 oz simple syrup. Add 2.5 oz bourbon. Top with ice. Stir. Garnsih lavishly with mint sprig.\n\nYour probably very well acquainted with the Mint Julep if you've ever been to a Kentucky Derby party, and if you've been to more than one Kentucky Derby party, you've probably noticed that those Mint Juleps tend to vary quite a great deal in terms of quality. I'm going to show you how to make an amazing Mint Julep and the key, as is with all things cocktail, is fresh ingredients. So that means fresh mint. None of this mint-flavored mix, none of that stuff.\n\nYou want fresh, real mint, the fresher the better. So I already picked about I don't know, 10 to 12 leaves, a pinch, a bunch, a bunch of mint. We're going to put this into our silver plated Julep cup. This is a traditional Julep cup, back in the 19th century. I mean it wasn't made in the 19th century, but it's a replica of that. You can use a rocks glass or you know any short glass you have around, but if you happen to get your hands on one of these, do it.\n\nOkay, so we've got our mint. All we need to make a Mint Julep is sugar, bourbon and ice, that's it, no citrus. So since there's no citrus, we want to make sure that there's not too much sugar. So here's our simple syrup, one to one sugar water, and do about half an ounce on my small jigger. And now we're going to muddle the mint. Now muddling does not mean pulverizing, especially with mint. This stuff is really delicate. You don't have to go too hard. \n\nAll you need to do is gently press the mint. You're not trying to crush it. You're just trying to extract the oils and you'll know that you've done your work when you can-- um, so good. I probably don't even need to tell you what it smells like. But when you can smell that fresh mint, you know you've muddled it enough. If it starts to smell kind of grassy, that means you've muddle it too hard, and released all those bitter tannin's, which you don't want.\n\nSo gently muddle the mint and now we're going to do two ounces of bourbon. And since there are so few ingredients in this cocktail, I would go with a higher quality bourbon. You know this drink is really potent, I'm going to do two and a half ounces, I just decided that. You don't need to skimp on the booze. Again, quality ingredients make quality cocktails. The last thing we need is our ice, and ice is almost more important in a Mint Julep, than it is with other cocktails.\n\nBecause if you've seen those Mint Julep's that kind of look like snow cones with the crushed ice, if you happen to be able to get your hands on one of these, this is a hand-crank, and old school hand-crank, ice crusher. It will make perfect little pellets of ice. I'm lucky enough to get my hands on one. You can get them for $30 on eBay, and it's totally worth it. \n\nA little extra effort, but you'll be relaxing in a minute, so you can afford to exercise those biceps a little bit. Okay, now if you don't have one of these, which I suspect that you don't, it's fine just to use smaller ice. You just don't want anything too big, because the smaller the ice is the faster it'll melt, the colder the drink will get, and the more dilution here you'll get.\n\n This drink is so potent that a little dilution is good, because it'll be too strong otherwise or you can always just use a spoon and crack the ice in your hand to make it small, but a little more effort. Ah, see that? Isn't that beautiful? Now I'm just going to take a bar spoon and gently mix this, so it gets all integrated and you see that frost developing on the glass there? That's what you want. That's all you need to do. \n\nThere's no shaking or stirring, so it makes that extra effort worth it with the hand-crank juicer. Okay, now for the garnish. If you've got extra mint around or maybe a mint in the garden or something, you can't skimp on it. Get a nice two big sprigs and jam them in there and this drink definitely needs a straw. There you go, the perfect, Mint Julep.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/HJa4XPdL5-g\n▶️ https://youtu.be/q-gYcvipozY\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

Well luckily it's a very simple process, because they've streamlined a lot of it into one option. We're gonna walk through really quickly how you can go ahead and do that. So right here I have the Playstation 4 box set up, it's not hooked up to a TV or anything, and I'm just gonna show you what goes where, and how you're gonna want to set this up.\n\nSo first off, you're gonna want to take your plug, your power plug. This will change, depending on the region you're in. This is for the North American region, so it's got the plug for North American outlets. This should be the same in all of them. And it's actually pretty much a symmetrical plug, you don't really have to worry about which prong's going where. And you just go ahead and plug it in. Once you plug that in to the wall, it's going to be turned off, and I'll show you where you're going to turn it on in just a second.\n\nNext up, you're going to grab your HDMI cable. HDMI is the only video output that the Playstation 4 supports officially. They've done away with composite and component. If you do find that you need that for your television set, you're gonna have to look into getting some sort of adapter or converter, and that's a whole other issue that you're gonna have to look into. But in the meantime, let's just take a look at the HDMI. It just goes right in there very simply, and the other end's either gonna go into your television, or it's gonna go into your receiver if you have a home theater set up. Whichever the inputs are going into, that's where it's gonna go.\n\nAnd as far as the back's concerned, that's all that's required. If you have a wired network, you don't want to use wireless and you have the Ethernet cable available, you could go right into that plug there. If you have a Playstation camera, you're gonna go into this proprietary little plug right here. And if you want to use digital audio out, or the optical audio, you're just gonna use that plug right there. And that's as far as setting up the back.\n\nNow once that's set up, we'll stand it up right here, you're gonna have to do a little bit of work in the front. The first time you set up a Playstation 4, it needs to pair the controller with the Playstation 4. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your micro-USB, and again, this is very similar to mini-USB, but it is not the same thing. So if you have extra mini-USBs lying around, they're not gonna be very helpful. But luckily you can get longer micro-USBs for a pretty cheap price. And you're gonna plug it into your controller, and that's gonna go into one of the two USB ports here, and these both use USB 3.0. And you're gonna plug it in there, and that's how those two are gonna sync.\n\nAnd then you could just turn it on. So right here, you have your eject button, and here you have your power button. Now it's sort of cheating to call these buttons, because they're not actually buttons. You don't press them in. What they really are are touch-sensitive spaces. So you just run your finger over them when you want to power them on. So you're gonna run your finger over this one to power it on, and it's gonna walk you through a step-by-step, very simple process to either log into your Playstation Network ID if you already have one from last gen, or it's gonna prompt you to create one.\n\nNow, making a Playstation Network account is completely free. There is no cost attached to it. Making a Playstation Plus account does have a cost attached to it, and that's gonna vary depending on how you're acquiring it. If you're doing it through Sony directly, you know, it's a flat monthly fee. Sometimes a lot of retailers will sell cards with about a year, or three months, six months, a year's worth of Playstation Plus. And that price can vary, depending on whatever deals they want to set up. And you're just gonna run through that, and you're gonna jump right into the menu, and you can start gaming.\n\nAgain, I can't stress enough, the real focus of the Playstation 4, and this generation in general, among all of the consoles, is to really minimize the amount of time it takes for you to hit the power button, to jump into a game. So that's just a quick look at how you want to physically set up the Playstation 4 and get started gaming.",

Stir and strain into Absinthe-rinsed frozen rocks glass. Expressed and discarded lemon twist.\n\nThere's no city that's more synonymous with cocktails than New Orleans, but only one cocktail is the official cocktail of New Orleans and that cocktail is the Sazerac. It's extremely easy to make, extremely delicious, here's how. We're going to start with two ounces of rye whiskey. Originally it was actually made with cognac, because that's a French ingredient, and as we know French and New Orleans have a log intertwined history. \n\nBut over time in the United States, it evolved into rye whiskey, which I think makes a better drink. It's sharper than cognac which is very elegant, but also kind of subtle. So two ounces of rye whiskey and a few dashes of Peychaud's Bitters. Peychaud's is just a different style of bitters, similar to Angostura which is what you might be used to, but it's a little brighter and has like a quality of anise to it that lends itself really nicely to this drink.  \n\nAgain, it's a French inventor. France, New Orleans, best of friends. One, two, three, I like to do four dashes. I also like to do one dash of Angostura bitters. This isn't officially how it's made, but I think it just gives it a little more depth. Like I said, the Peychaud's are just very bright and I think it's nice to ground it a little bit with a little bit of Angostura.  \n\nAnd now we need a sweetener and we're just going to use regular simple syrup. One to one simple syrup. Just a bar spoon or a teaspoon. You really want to be careful when you're using simple syrup in drinks like a Sazerac or an Old Fashioned, because they can get sweet really fast. There's no citrus in here so there's nothing to balance out that sweetness. Just enough to take the edge off the whiskey, but not too much to make it really sugary.\n\nSpeaking of the Old Fashioned, you'll notice its really similar to an Old Fashioned, a Sazerac is. It's just different bitters and little tweaks here and there, but same idea. Same template, different ingredients. And we're going to stir a Sazerac, because again it's all booze, there's no citrus in there we don't have to force any of the ingredients together.\n\nAll right, we've got about 20 seconds or so 25 seconds, and before I'm done stirring I'm going to grab my glass and show you the kicker to make the perfect Sazerca. Now it's my frozen rocks glass, but we're not going to put any rocks in this. We're going to serve this cocktail neat, which means no rocks. But before we do that we're going to rinse the glass in absinthe.  \n\nSo I've got some absinthe here and if you're wondering, that whole myth about absinthe making you crazy and turning you into a turn of the century Bohemian artist in Paris, that's not true. It's pretty much a combination of a smear campaign, by the wine industry, and just a legend sort of evolving over time  Absinthe is fine to drink. You would probably die of alcohol poisoning, before you drank enough absinthe to hallucinate.\n\nSo we're just going to rinse the glass in absinthe, because it's so potent and so high in alcohol.  Like I said, you'd have to drink a lot of it to hallucinate, but not a lot to get alcohol poisoning. So just a little bit, a few dashes are going to sort of coat the glass, and give you this bouquet of aromatics that are really going to impact the drink when you drink it. And you can drink this or you can dump it out. It's early so I'm just going to dump it out.  Mm, smells delicious.\n\nNow we're going to finish stirring. It's okay to leave your ice melting , as long as you're not stirring, it's not going to dilute too much. Just don't forget about it, because you don't want to over dilute. Now I'm going to strain this baby in there. I know this looks like a really short drink, but trust me it packs a pretty serious punch. And for the garnish we're just going to do a lemon peel. Now we're just going to twist or peel off  a little slice of lemon.  \n\nI don't like those knives that have that really deep thin peel, because you get too much of the pith which is bitter, and this way with the larger swath of lemon I can do this. If you hold the white part towards you and then the outside towards the glass and gently squeeze it, I don't know if you can see it, but there are oils expressed through the pores of the lemon into the drink, and oh  yeah, you really get it. \n\nEven with that absinthe in there you can really smell the lemon. And I'm not going to drop the peel in there. I'm just goi\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/8OFFnpCoUXg\n▶️ https://youtu.be/nh_3suGRbN8\n\n\n#Howcast \n\nRelated searches:\nbest sazerac recipe\nwhat are the ingredients of a sazerac",

                "description": "How to Make Cocktails Playlist with tom Macy https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJxNvoq3gXjucZOGPf9RRfX5TqF6AHw1\n\nHow to Make a Martini | Cocktail Recipes\n\nRecipe: 2 oz London Dry Gin; 1 oz Dry Vermouth. Stir, serve up. Garnish with an olive or a twist.\n\nThe martini is pretty much the most famous cocktail ever, it needs no introduction. However even though everybody knows it, there are about a million different ways to drink them. People like them shaken, stirred, up, on the rocks, olives, twist, dirty, dry. Just like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup, there's no wrong way to drink a martini.  But, I'm going to show you the classic way to make a martini, and it might surprise you actually, because classically martini's were made with gin and not vodka.  \n\nOver time, I think because the popularity of vodka, somehow vodka just overtook the primary ingredient in most martini's. Now people don't even specify if they want vodka or gin. They just assume it's made with Vodka. Originally it was made with gin. The reason for this is that in the 19th century when all of these classic cocktails were invented, vodka didn't really exist in the United States. \n\nIt did over in Russia, but it wasn't until the 1940's that vodka came over and it didn't get popular until the 1950's, which is then when people started drinking martini's with vodka. So we're going to make it the classic way and for my money the better way, but again do whatever you want.  People always get angry when I mess with their martini. Do it, it's your martini, you do whatever you need to do.\n\nTwo ounces of gin, London Dry Gin. I like stuff that's a little higher proof, because I think when you're stirring stuff with ice it's always going to dilute, so the higher the proof the more flavor you're going to get. That's another great reason to use gin, is that there's flavor in it. Vodka doesn't taste like anything, but drink it if you want. \n\nAnd we're going to do one whole ounce of dry vermouth. I know a lot of people like to make really dry martini's, but that's just vodka chilled. That's not a cocktail, much less a martini. So I think that vermouth adds more flavor to the drink and I don't know when this whole idea of the drier the martini, the more manly you are. That seems to be some sort of power play that businessmen in the 1950's invented. I don't get it. I think that knowing how to make a good cocktail or order a good cocktail and knowing why, displays much more confidence therefore much more manliness, but what do I know. \n\nSo that's it, it's just the two ingredients. Of course, if you want to make a dirty martini you'll use a little olive brine. We're not going to do that here. I like my martini's clean. Now a little more ice. As I've said before, I like to have the ice kind of peeking out, kind of like an iceberg in the mixing glass. And you'll notice I'm stirring this martini, with apologizes to James Bond. He's the only one I give a pass to, but I honestly see no reason why you would shake a martini. \n\nIt will dilute the drink more, make it a weaker drink and the texture will be totally degraded.  They'll get ice chips in there, you'll get all kinds of ice bubbles. A far inferior drink to a nice stirred Martini. All right, a good 20-25 seconds of stirring for proper chilling and dilution. Let's get out chilled cocktail glass that we have put in the freezer, right before I started this. This is a Coop glass. It's not the martini, the big V that you're used to seeing. I think that those are fine when they're small, although they're impossible. You've possibly spilled them more than you drink them. \n\nBut those giant 12 ounce glasses, I mean can you even finish a 12 ounce martini, and if you can why are you even bothering spending the time to make it? Why not, if you need to get that drunk, really just do us all a favor drink some grain alcohol. So there, a perfectly made gin classic martini. You can do it with olives or a twist for garnish. I like doing it with a twist, but a simple green olive, I think is the iconic garnish and that's how you make a classic Martini.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3xFDbSgFPw0\n▶️ https://youtu.be/P97PuL0hLOg\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

There actually is some techniques that are a good idea to master.\n\nI've already built my cocktail in here. Now, this is a two piece tin. You can use the three piece ones, which are sort of self-explanatory.\n\nI like these better because the ice really can travel and can chill the drink properly, chill it faster and then give it that really great, frothy texture that you want. Which is ideal for optimal deliciousness. \n\nSo, I've already built my drink in the small part of the tin. If I build it in the big part it might overflow when I combine them. So, small tin.\n\nAnd now, we want to form that seal. Okay? So when you lift it up like that it stays together.\n\nYou'll notice that I have one part flush and then, so then there's the maximum distance here. Remember that.\n\nSo, I have two cocktails built here. And just to show off I'm going to shake them both.\n\nAlright. So, if you're shaking two you want to hold them with two fingers on each side so that if you feel them separating you'll notice and you can, sort of, stop.\n\nYou should never be afraid of them separating on you if you form a tight enough seal. And if you're holding them properly, if it starts to break, you'll know before you make a mess.\n\nIf you're shaking one cocktail you can hold it together with both hands. But that's not what we're doing. We're going to go big today.\n\nSo, I'm going to be alone with my shakers while I rock this out.\n\nDo you need to have a catchy rhythm when you're shaking? No. Should you? Yes. \n\nOkay. You hear that? That's the seal already starting to break. Okay.\n\nSo, now we're going to break the seal. I'm not going to hit it on the part that's flush and I'm not going to try to break it on the largest distance. I'm going to go right in between. That sort of half way point.\n\nWith the palm of your hand. When you hear it start to hiss like that you know you already broke the seal. And then, just sort of jimmy it off.\n\nIt takes some practice to really get a feel for it. I've done this probably a thousand times. So, I really know how to do it.\n\nBut, don't feel bad if you're just like doing it a million times and can't get it. You'll figure it out. Just don't get frustrated. Don't get mad at the shaker. The shaker is your friend.\n\nOkay. Now we're going to strain this cocktail. Pretty much any time you're shaking something you're going to strain it.\n\nEven if it's going to be on the rocks, you don't really want to pour it out from the shaker because all that ice is going to be broken. It's going to melt really fast. You want to pour that over fresh ice.\n\nIn this case we have an up glass. So, we're going to take our Hawthorne Strainer. It's called that for over 100 years. People aren't exactly sure why. They think it was because this guy Hawthorne invented it in the late 19th century. I'm pretty sure they're right but we'll probably never know.\n\nAnd I'm going to fine strain this. As you'll see, this is a daiquiri here, there aren't any ice chips on top. It just gives it a silkier texture.\n\nAnd, there you have it. That is how  you shake and how you strain a cocktail.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/3xFDbSgFPw0\n▶️ https://youtu.be/P97PuL0hLOg\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

                "description": "How to Make Cocktails Playlist with tom Macy https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJxNvoq3gXjucZOGPf9RRfX5TqF6AHw1\n\n\nHow to Make Ginger Simple Syrup | Cocktail Recipes\n\nI'm going to show you how to make one of the best, most versatile, and most delicious ingredients for cocktails, ginger syrup. It's not nearly as hard as you think. So we're going to take a nice, big piece of ginger. I'm not even going to use all of it, just half of it and cut it up in sort of quarter size pieces. Just what's easier to process. \n\nEven though I'm going to show you how to make ginger syrup, you can make simple syrups from almost any flavor, any fruit, vegetable, herb. All you're really doing is taking your normal simple syrup, sugar and water, and adding whatever flavor you want. Sometimes, you can just heat up the simple syrup and add the ingredient, like mint simple syrup. You just steep the mint. Sometimes, something denser like ginger, we're going to have to simmer and boil it first to really get that really spicy ginger flavor in there. Making fresh syrups like this and flavored syrups is one of the best ways to add variety to your cocktails. If you want to make, say, a ginger daiquiri or something, you just replace the ginger syrup with simple syrup and that's it.\n\nSo now we have sliced ginger. We're going to add this to the food processor. I didn't peel this ginger. You can; it gives it a little cleaner feeling, but I don't mind the robustness of the peel. I also think that peeling is a tedious step. It's optional either way. It will make a good product. Now we just coarsely chop this. Great sound. I've got to get the last pieces. There we go. Mm, delicious. \n\nAll right. So I've got my measuring cup and the pot that I'm going to put this over the stove with. So I like to do about one part ginger to one and a half parts water. Let's get all of that in there, and, again, it's always a good idea to have your rag on hand because any time we're in the kitchen or making stuff with cocktails, a mess is probable. \n\nAll right. Let's see. What have we got? Okay. So that's about one and a half cups of ginger, so one and a half parts of that is going to be two and a quarter cups. Math is also a skill you might want to have when making cocktails. Simple math, not like pre-calc or anything, which is when I just went off the rails. I was good up until pre-calc, and then never again.\n\nSo you kind of eyeball this, I mean, about two and a quarter cups of water. Now what we're going to do is we're going to simmer this. We're going to bring it to a boil and simmer it for about 30 minutes so that the liquid reduces and really soaks up that ginger flavor. So now that I've simmered my ginger for about 30 minutes or so and reduced it, I'm going to strain out all of that ginger. We've got the strainer here, and it's always good to have a trash can handy so that you can do this. \n\nNow we're just going to make regular simple syrup with this. Pretend that this is your water, in this case, your ginger water, and we're going to do one part ginger to one part sugar. That's a cup, so I'm going to add one cup of sugar. And again, you can eyeball this. That's just about two cups, a little under, but I think it'll be plenty sweet. And since you just took it off the stove, it should be good and hot. Make sure you use glass, of course, with this, but It will dissolve right into the sugar, and you will be done.\n\nThat is how you make ginger syrup.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/vBmTVU54F0g\n▶️ https://youtu.be/HJa4XPdL5-g\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

So there are a couple ways you can do this. Option number 1, leaving your knees on the ground, your feet stacked, your elbow under your shoulder, arm up. You're just going to come up and down. You want control and you want to make sure at the top you're lifting as high as you can.\n\n Progression from here, legs straight, elbows still under your shoulder, arm up again, same thing. You'er lifting, you're very active in this and I like to use the analogy as if someone had a string around your hips and they were pulling you up. You want to make sure you get as high as you can. You can also from here, if you want to more shoulder, go to your hand and your shoulder, so this is a little bit more shoulder involved ad then from there do your hip lifts. And that's how you do a side plank with hip lifts.\n\n💌 Let's stay Connected 💌\n➡️ our website:https://www.howcast.com/\n➡️ Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/howcast\n➡️ https://www.instagram.com/howcast/\n\n\n✨ If you liked this video, I'm sure you'll like these videos as well\n▶️ https://youtu.be/HVyHcalg61g\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ihG0E_4_tCM\n\n\nAbout us:- \nEmphasizing high-quality instructional video production, Howcast brings you leading experts and accurate, reliable information on makeup tutorials, cute hairstyles, and nail art designs to soccer tricks, parkour, and skateboarding, plus how to Dougie, how to kiss, and much, much more.

So the old school sit up when you go all the way up, out the window. Those are not good for your back and the hip flexors get involved, which we don't want. So, what I'm going to teach you today is how to do the jaundice sit up. So, you're going to lie back, you're gong to bend your legs at 90 degrees. You're going to make sure your stomach is flat, flush against the ground, your rib cage down. That's the most important thing; you want to make sure there's no space between your back and the ground. \n\nThen you're going to support your head with your hands. You're going to take a deep inhale through your nose. As you exhale you're going to come up and I like to give the analogy, as if you were deflating a balloon, that's what you want to think of your belly as, a balloon. And you're getting all that air out as hard as you can. A deep exhale out, you're going to inhale on the way back down. So, again, hands behind your head, inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouth making sure everything stays flush and then lie back down. You can do that for about 10 reps, and that's how to do a proper sit-up.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDriZ7JgmfxOc40hRTnYSt6Gx\n-\n-\nWatch more How to Do Stop Motion Animation videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/514877-How-to-Make-a-Wire-Puppet-Stop-Motion\n\n\n\nSo, how do you make a good, sturdy puppet for animation? There are a number of ways that you could create a puppet for your animation. I like to start with a wire armature and build from that wire armature. So, I take some aluminum wire, kind of a thinner gauge like this. And I've rolled out a pretty long piece.  \n\nAnd I'm going to fold that piece this way and then cut it so I now have this length of wire. I'm going to start at the top. The loose ends meet down at the bottom. I'm going to take my finger and my thumb, and pinch and twist the wire to create a kind of a neck for my puppet. I'm going to then take another piece of the wire, loop it out, pinch there at the base of the neck, and twist my puppet's first arm. When I pinch out the the next arm from the wire, I'm going to do it with a longer piece of wire. I'm also going to measure up and make sure that the arm is roughly matched with the other one, and we'll pinch and twist that as well. Now that we have two arms and our neck, we will pinch and twist the body. Next I will roll in the wire, wrap it back in to the back, and this will be for the first leg. You want to tuck those loose ends in once you roll them in there. It's not a bad thing to give your wire armature decent-sized feet so he can stand. You can always reduce the size of the foot later, but at least to start, you might want some of the extra wire there. Measure out for your next leg. \n\nThere. And twist that in. Twist. Next leg. And you're starting to get a sort of a humanoid form, human form. This of course could also become a four-legged creature of some kind if you just bend it down. So, the wire acts as a kind of a skeleton for your puppet. But if you'd like to bulk it out a bit, you can use Styrofoam, and you can cut that Styrofoam down if you need to. You can also shape Styrofoam with your fingers. If you want to give your puppet a belly, a chest, you can add that. And with some masking tape, lock it onto your armature. We'll go back to him standing up for a moment. Another thing you can do is add a little wood to the leg to give your armature a knee. This also strengthens the legs of the armature. I'm using a very thin dowel here, but you could use bamboo skewers or even toothpicks if they're long enough. I've got the wood against the leg and I'm going to tape it on. You should always have masking tape within reach when you're building puppets. Really, when you're building anything. \n\nAnd I'm wrapping the tape around the wire and the wood. I want to get exactly the length of the leg covered. And I wrap that tape in nice and tight with no air pockets. Make sure that the mechanics of it work. I'm going to break that leg off the bottom there, so now I have this straight leg, and I'll adjust it and then break the knee in there as well. So, this is the only place where that will bend, otherwise it stays straight. You can do this for the arms as well. It helps to do it for both legs. \n\nHere's another similar guy. He has both of his legs already on there, and we've taped in a nice, big belly for him. So, here we have him. A beautiful armature filled out with some Styrofoam and some wood, all ready to go. He's standing, which is a good sign. We haven't even added any clay yet to his feet and he's already standing. And he's ready to become the character he's meant to be.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDriZ7JgmfxOc40hRTnYSt6Gx\n-\n-\nWatch more How to Do Stop Motion Animation videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/514871-How-to-Create-Clay-Scenery-Stop-Motion\n\n\n\nOnce you've created your clay character, perhaps you'd like to make a place for the character to animate in. Dressing your set in an animation is important, of course, and there are many directions you can go in. We're going to be working with a camera directly in front of us, shooting against this backdrop here. You could use any color of fabric or paper to create your backdrop. \n\nThis is a nice light blue, sort of for a daytime sky. It's mounted on a piece of foam board with something heavy taped to the back of it so it stands up. Next I think we'll add some hills, little green rolling hills, and we can do this by starting with a piece of cardboard and drawing out our little hills on the cardboard, and then cutting with an Exacto knife or scissors into the cardboard. And you want to cut your hills out, and in most cases you should be able to just pop it right off once you've cut with a knife. Cutting with scissors might take a little bit longer. Whatever gets you there. And you have your hill piece just like this, which depending on how you like to animate, you could just make it work just like that, or you could begin to cover your hill with green clay, whatever color you'd like your hill to be. And you can take bits of that clay and just smear it right on there. Once you've covered your entire hill, you might get something like this. You can texture it with a tool, add details. \n\nA little piece of clay on the back is good to keep it sturdy and standing, and then you can set it up right in your scene there. So we have a couple of little rolling hills, again simply by cardboard back, smearing clay onto the front. Next we could do a tree perhaps, and rather than just build the tree out of clay, we're going to use what is called a wire armature. This is just an aluminum wire. You can get it in most art stores and sculpture stores, maybe even some hardware stores. To create a very basic tree trunk form, you take the wire between your fingers, do a little loop down there on the bottom, and just start to twist that wire, twisting the wire until you feel like you have a sufficient trunk, and then you have two branches coming off of the top. That loop I like to take and kind of stand up. You can cover that armature with clay. Take some brown clay to represent the tree bark, small amounts of it. We'll just press it onto that wire and coat the wire all the way up the trunk. And what the wire enables you to do is create a form that is fairly skinny, thin, but that will stand up. The clay alone, without the wire acting as a sort of a structure or skeleton, would fall over. We'll use some moss for the leaves of the tree, and you can get moss outside, of course. But you can also purchase moss. There are not really right and wrong answers here. It's about how you'd like to creatively interpret your scene. \"Creative\" being the word of choice. Get creative with it. I'm using these bits of wire up at the top and spearing the moss right in there, nice bright green contrasting with our brown tree trunk. Add that in there. One more touch we could add would be clouds. And just like everything else, you can go in a number of directions with your clouds. I like good old cotton. You can rip open a stuffed animal, an unloved stuffed animal, and take the cotton out of that stuffed animal. You can also buy cotton. You can use cotton swabs. I've added a little bit of masking tape to the back of the cotton, and I can just pop that in there. And now we're really getting a sense of place for our animation, some wonderful trees, some hills. Of course we have our blue sky and these nice cotton clouds as well. And you could animate your clouds to move back and forth in the sky. You could animate your trees to blow in the breeze. And of course, we could use maybe a little character here as well, a red dog perhaps. Not a big red dog, just a medium-sized red dog. So there it is. We have a scene now, complete with a character. Remember as you're creating a set for your animation, be creative with it. A lot of the elements that you might use to find your sense of place are things you can find around the house, at the local store. So go for it, and have fun.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDriZ7JgmfxOc40hRTnYSt6Gx\n-\n-\nWatch more How to Do Stop Motion Animation videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/514870-How-to-Create-a-Clay-Character-Stop-Motion\n\n\n\nSo if you'd like to make a clay character or a clay puppet to be animated, there area  few great tips I can give you. First, get some clay. The clay that you animate with is really up to you. There are a variety of modeling clays on the market. You're probably looking for a non-drying, non-hardening modeling clay, something with wax or oil in it so that your puppets don't harden up on while you're animating. That would be a bad thing. So we have some of this red modeling clay here, and I'm taking a whole bar, and I'm softening the clay in my hands first. When the clay feels soft enough, I'll roll it out. And I think I'll start by making a very basic humanoid puppet, two arms, two legs, a head. \n\nYou want to keep in mind that your puppet needs to be sturdy. So using your finger and your thumb, you can start on the bottom of your oval of clay by pinching out a leg and another leg like so. As you're pinching, keep in mind You want your creation to be able to stand, maybe even walk in your animation. So you want to keep those legs fairly thick. You want to bring a head and two arms out on top. Same pincher fingers, same approach. We'll start with the head, gently pinching one way and the other way. And really I'm not pinching the head right now. I'm pinching a neck. \n\nYou leave yourself a little clay up on the top, and that will actually just be your head, and you can round it off. Be gentle as you pinch. Try standing again. Once you have that head, you can pinch out an arm on one side and an arm from the other side. Stand him up again. Is your figure animatable? \n\nDoes he or she balance? These are important things to consider when you're building a puppet to be animated. So we could also create a four-legged creature. It's a similar approach. Suppose we were making a dog. Pincher fingers. You can start almost anywhere on the puppet, but pinch out that neck and that head first. It's great to work from one piece of clay, rather than taking a piece off of another piece of clay and sticking it on, say for the tail of your dog, where it's likely to maybe just fall off during animation. You don't want that. It's best to pinch that tail. I'm pinching the legs of the dog. Again, you just want to consider will the animal stand? Can you animate? So again, when you're making a clay puppet to be animated, use one block of clay, one piece of clay. Pinch those parts out. \n\nMake sure your subject can stand, that you can move isolated parts of him or her. And of course, this is just the beginning. You can add eyes, a nose. You can add a mouth to your puppet. Different colors, accessories. But this is a great way to start and perfectly ready for animating.",

So a lot of the headaches happen due to tension, either behind the eyes, or it's on the lateral or the sides of the head. So you want to actually just help to disperse the tension that gets bunched up right in this temporal area. So you wanna just engage the muscle and pull towards you, slowly. And you're going to feel the fibers more so here of the musculature of the temporal-is muscle. \n\nAnd it's going to feel a little bit more bulbous on one side than the other. And you're just slowly pulling the fasha and releasing the tension, doing a downward motion; literally pulling the tension away. And a really good point at that end is where a particular temporalis and porietum of bones meet, and it's a really good circular point to activate and to disperse the bunched up fascia there as well. And you can literally do a front side pick, it's a little bit of a cranial circle movement. \n\nYou want to place your fingers right along the edge of the eyebrows and the top of the forehead and pull towards you, this way. This helps decompress some of the pressure that starts to build up when you have a tension headache. That would lead you to our favorite spot, right in between the eyebrows, and to lift up towards you to release some of the pressure that builds up behind the eyes when you have tension headaches. Put it all together and you just want to wash away the forehead and bring it towards the crown of the head. \n\nThe other aspect of tension that creates headaches is also tightness in the neck, so you always want to address the neck as well. So, I'm just gonna show it from the side of the view, but the area that you want to hit is, or actually press is right behind the ears, it's a Chinese meridian point, gull bladder twenty. And you are going to find it in the bony process behind the ears, and so you want to put both your fingers on both sides and lift towards you. Feels really yummy on the deep musculature of the neck. And the decompressing is really wonderful for the back of the head. \n\nAnd just gonna wait there until you find a release and that side of release is very slow but if you wait, it will definitely happen. And you can just disperse the energy of the head by just doing some gliding techniques, as such. And that's how to massage the head to relieve headaches.",

This is another one of my no-cook, easy prep favorites. A little more so than a banana but when you have a ripe kiwi there's not much involved. So the first step is peeling it. There - you know, furry skin is definitely not something that's palatable for young babies, so you want to make sure and get rid of that.\n\nA lot of people will ask about the seeds. The seeds are actually very nutrient dense, so it really comes down to a preference on texture for your individual child. So if you notice that they're - they don't seem to like kiwi, you can always try keeping the seeds out and giving them the purée without it to see if that might be the culprit.\n\nKiwis do not need to be cooked, so you just cut them raw. I prefer to get them in chunks so they're easier to turn in your blender. Once we have them cut, put them in a bowl. We have a total of three kiwis here, which is a great portion size.\n\nKiwis are amazing to keep both in the fridge or the freezer. So you would just want to add them in to your high speed blender or food processor. And we're going to turn it on and let it run for about twenty to thirty seconds until we reach a nice thin purée.\n\nSo once it's turned about twenty or thirty seconds you're good to go. Sometimes chunks will collect on the side so you may have to scrape it down and reblend a few times, but for the most part kiwi when it's nice and ripe will come out to a nice thin purée straight away. So, you just want to portion a size out to serve your baby. So then you're good to go with your kiwi baby food purée.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrg1rxx7Vo5bxMz4J7lj7Viq\n-\n-\nWatch more How to Make Your Own Baby Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/515557-How-to-Make-Baby-Applesauce-Baby-Food\n\n\n\nWe're going to talk about making your own baby apple puree or applesauce if you have some older toddlers in the house. What you want to start off with is a sweeter varity of apple. I'm a huge fan of Gala, Hunnycrust, or even Red Delicious comes out very beautifully. Depending on you know, the quanity your making, if your doing just a few small servings I tend to prefer to leave the peel on because about ninety percent of an apples' nutritional content will be in the peel. So if you peel it, you're removing so many beneficial nutrients for your child. So, one of the big things that you want to focus on when your slicing in order to steam the apples, is to try to uniformly slice them so they cook evenly. \n\nSo, you know, every chunk will be slightly different but if they're more or less the same size then they will cook evenly once they're in the steamer. So, apples are really fantastic. They're one of the most high scorces of fiber that you can find for children. So if you do have a child that's having constipation issues this is a really great food to offer them to keep the system moving along so to speak. So, we have three apples sliced up here that we're going to put in the steam basket. And the reason that I prefer to steam is that it will retain the most amount of nutrients for your child verses roasting or boiling. So, we'll add these apples to our steamer, and then we're going to give it four to five minutes until it's fork tender. \n\nAlright so, now that our apples have been steaming about four to five minutes depending on how small or large you slice them. you just want to make sure they're nice and fork tender before you pull them out. So, I use a slotted spoon and a regualr just table fork to test the softness. Good to go. So now they're fork tender, we'll add them to the high speed food processor or blender. Come on over here. And depending on the apple of ridles like a Red Delicious are probably going to come out like a little bit waterier. So you want to screen off any exsess water. these are Gala so they tend to have a little less water in them so will not have an issue with water. When you are preparing purees, I tend to start on the thicker side, so you want to take out a lot of the extra water because it's always much eaiser to thin them down than it is to thicken them back up. And as your baby grow they'll tend to prefer the thicker as opposed to the thin. So, we'll just flip on the blender and blend about twenty to thirty seconds. \n\nAlright, so now that twenty thirty seconds has gone by we're down to a nice smooth consistancy and you just portion it out into your serving dish. And you're ready to go. One of my favorite things, especially during colder winter months is to add a little bit of cinnamon. I think it's great to introduce babies to spices. The earlier the better. And apples are a fantastic puree that you can add cinnamon to.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDriZ7JgmfxOc40hRTnYSt6Gx\n-\n-\nWatch more How to Do Stop Motion Animation videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/514863-How-to-Animate-Water-Stop-Motion\n\n\n\nHow to animate water is a great question, and there are so many different ways to animate water in stop motion animation. One way that I like to do it is with clear hair gel. Now this can get a little bit messy, of course. Keep this in mind if you're trying it. \n\nBut the hair gel has a great water look, obviously, when it's transparent. And what we're going to do is lay the hair gel over this little riverbed that we've created. The riverbed has been made with a brownish clay, and then we've stuck a bunch of actual rocks and shells into the clay to have that sort of bottom of the riverbed look. We have two pieces of cardboard, and they've been covered with green clay, and we've textured them to look like grass. So these are the banks of our river. \n\nOur hope is to spoon some of the hair gel right into the river and then just manipulate it slightly, animate it slightly as we're picking up our images from the camera directly above the river. So here we go. I think it's best to spoon the gel in, and you want to avoid getting the gel on the grass. You only want the gel over the rocks in the riverbed. We've raised the banks on the cardboard on either side, so if the gel does start to run, which it will as it warms up, it doesn't run onto the grass but runs underneath it. Hair gel is gross. Just going to say that. Now it's time-sensitive. Again, as the gel starts to heat under the light, it will liquefy and start to melt out. We want to use it just as it is right now in this moment. So we'll take a picture, and I may use the spoon instead of my hand to manipulate the gel. \n\nI want to do this in a very even fashion. I'm going to drag through, just moving that gel slightly. And I'm going to take a picture. I'm going to go back through. I'm going to just drag the spoon along the surface of the gel and take a picture. Dragging it along the surface. Things to keep in mind, the water in a river like this would be flowing in one direction only, most likely. So keep your movement's going in one direction, like the band. It's actually very therapeutic and soothing to animate hair gel. So there you have it. Now I can go back through here and cut and paste our frames so that we get a nice, longer animation of the river flowing. We'll play it, and there it is. Very, very cool. \n\nThere you have it. This is one way, a fairly complicated, maybe sticky way, of animating water. Try this at home. Try some new water animation techniques. Let your creativity flow.",

I'm Mike Patrick and this is how to do a one-handed shuffle. It looks like this. You take the cards and shuffle them with one hand like this. The grip is a little bit unusual. You have three fingers on one end of the deck and your pinky and thumb on the other side. So, if I remove the deck, it's like this and if I place the deck back it's around here. What you're going to do is divide approximately, and you want this to be relatively exact, you want to get half the deck to break off with your thumb. I lift up with my thumb here. These two fingers let go let go at this point. I'm going to move my thumb counterclockwise, pivoting along the index finger and this packet is going to move clockwise. This is what it's going to look like. These two move at the same rate until they're here. \n\nThe two outer fingers now regroup this edge and pull it so that they are even with each other. It's a very slight adjustment when this happens, about a quarter of an inch, depending on your hand size. You then take the two back portions and you shuffle those together with even pressure from your thumb. This is going to take the most work. One more time, you have the pinky here and the thumb. You break upwards with your thumb. Your fingers move out of the way. It pivots around the index finger so they swirl on opposite directions. I reapply those two fingers, aligning the packets. And now I place those together and I cause them to weave at an angle. So now I should have sort of a V from my perspective. Now the cards are ready to be bridged. I turn them over. \n\nI apply pressure like in a normal shuffle and I let go of them. They will fall over the floor when you try to do this. It's unavoidable but eventually you can use your hand or cradle if you feel more comfortable. But eventually over time you should just be able to do it in the air like this. I'll go over it really slowly one more time. The pinky is here towards this pip on that side. The thumb breaks the packet. I remove these fingers and I pivot this across. They're aligned with each other. These cards get farrowed the other cards and then I turn over and I shuffle them like this. Here's one quick variation that I can show you that I do. You can cut off about a third of the deck. If you do that, when these cards are in this orientation you can use your index finger to move this packet forward so this just pivots along these, goes into this hand, and you do a thumb cut so your thumb comes over. This opens up. And you can shuffle these into each other. This is going like this. And then you close. You see that in speed it looks like this. And that is how to do a one-handed shuffle.",

                "description": "Full Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLALQuK1NDrjRhk7bbPTdHlkv1C0fgJy7\n-\n-\nGreat Amazon Must Haves for any Cat Owner:\r\n\r\nFeline GREENIES Dental Treats for Cats: http://amzn.to/1UrL9rm\r\nFour Paws Magic Coat Love Glove Cat Grooming Mitt: http://amzn.to/1O8XYVQ\r\nBergan Star Chaser Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy: http://amzn.to/1EBqPSY\r\nIRIS Open Top Litter Box with Shield and Scoop: http://amzn.to/1VwpII5\n\nWatch more How to Take Care of a Cat videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/514839-Dealing-w-Cat-That-Scratches-or-Bites-Cat-Care\n\n\n\nDo you have a cat that gets aggressive when you play? Most of the time those are young cats, and it's a super common problem. When you think about it, it's no wonder that they do because, most of us are actually taught to play with cats in a way that will cause them to scratch and bite you, and in fact ,we roughhouse with kittens all the time. Unfortunately, when you roughhouse with a kitten with your hands or your feet. You are really teaching that cat to go ahead and target predatory play towards your fingers and toes, and that's pretty much the last thing that people want on a regular basis. So, it's so important that when you are going to teach your cat about how to play people that you play with remote toys. So that they're more interested in playing with objects rather than your hands. \n\nIf you're going to try and work on a cat that is already started doing some aggressive play behaviors, then you want to start by making sure that you have appropriate toys to play with cat. One of the most common toys that cats enjoy are called wand toys, and they look like fishing poles and they have a great little object at the end, and there is a variety of companies that make them and these are called Nico flies and they have a lot of really great interesting ones. And what you want to do is really focus on all of your play with your cat, being with toys like this, rather than your hands on your feet. So when you think about it, a lot of cats really enjoy predatory play of all different types and that might be like moving the toy along the ground like this, dangling the toy at the top of the cat so they can bat it around, and if I were on the floor we could do this with the long wand but here's the reason to use it. \n\nAnd I can see that she's really liking this. See how her whiskers are a little puckered out and their forward, she's really  interested in this particular toy. Which is common this particular toy is really popular with cats and also throwing the toy so the cat can chase it, and than moving it at different rates. The other thing that you can do to play with kitty cats is put toys that have food in them on the floor and roll them around so that when you roll them and the cat rolls them treats fall out. So those are things that are really fun for cats that don't involve your hands as the trigger for the aggressive behavior. The other thing to keep in mind though is that when you play with a cat, even with these types of toys, you may find especially in a cat that's had a lot of experience doing aggressive play that they target your hands and feet right often bat. So if you can get one or two seconds of appropriate play in, that's a great way to go play for a couple of seconds and if you feel like you need to end the session so that your cat doesn't get too agitated and then start to bunny kick, hiss, or growl. Than go ahead, give them a treat and come back later. \n\nWhen you do that you're teaching the cat we can have play sessions that don't involve aggressive behavior, in addition you can continue to play until your cat starts to have troubles, but the problem with that is that then the cat might get too aggressive and every time you end your session the cat is learning that \"oh well I just get more and more agitated when we play\" instead we like the cat to always be playing and having a good time. So really focus on ending your session before your cat gets aggressive, but if there's any moment  where the cat starts to bite at you, or certainly hiss at you, or grab at you than \"say too bad\" and end the session completely, and that's one great way to help your cat learn to play less aggressively.",

There are amazing herbal remedies that one can find. This particular ointment of oil has a combination of rosemary, burdock roots, and stinging nettle. And those key ingredients, that are all naturally based, help to stimulate the hair follicles, create circulation and thereby helping your hair grow, in a faster manner. \n\nSo, as the oil application is applied on sections of the head, on a even manner, you can massage the oil on the scalp very gently, but thoroughly. You can do this yourself at home, but you really need to be committed to a regular routine. It's not one of those, oh I just, you know, will do it once a month kind of scenarios. You really want to be committed to doing this for yourself, or your loved one, or your recipient, on a daily manner, in order for the hair follicles to really improve circulation and create a healthier medium for your hair to grow faster and stronger. \n\nAnd you just want to, just make sure that you're covering the entire surface of the head, including; the back of the neck, and obviously the crown and the forehead area where most of the hair growth starts to decease.

Shaoxing cooking wine;1/2 tsp. sesame oil. RECIPE: Combine all ingredients and stir vigorously.\n\nI'd like to show you how to make filling for won-tons and dumplings. \n\nFirst, we're going to start with some ground pork. Pork is by far the Chinese meat of choice. I like it because it's not too intense in flavor but it's still got a nice meatiness. \n\nNext, I'm going to add some sugar and some tapioca starch. Tapioca starch is used a lot in Chinese cooking. It's what makes that nice, clear, thick sauce you see a lot but also it helps keep meat pretty juicy. It also has a nice coat on it when you fry it or sear it. But here we're just going to incorporate that into the pork to keep it nice and moist as we fold it into won-tons and dumplings.\n\nNext, we're going to add some tea flavored tofu. You'll find this in a lot of Chinese grocery markets. It's this interesting savory, aromatic tofu. I love to add it. I think it pairs really well with chives and scallions which we'll add in just a moment here. \n\nWe're going to add here some ginger, scallions and chives. I like having the dual \"onion-y\" taste in this. It adds a really beautiful color. \n\nThen we got salt and some fresh shitake. I like using fresh shitake. It has a nicer texture but if you're really in a pinch you can rehydrate the shitake and chop it up and put it in filling.\n\nFinally we got some soy sauce, a little sesame oil and shaoxing cooking wine which is kind of like dry sherry. You can also use it for deglazing a pan. A lot of times what you would use, I would say, dry wine for. You're going to mix this all together. As you can see, this is still not totally coming together which is why I usually add an egg as a nice binder.\n\nNow, just stir that in there and if you really want to mix it well, which you do, since you want every little bite of won-ton and dumpling to be flavorful, you can use your hands. \n\nIt should have a nice squishy consistency. It shouldn't be running too much but it should all stick together so you can form a little ball with it at the end. \n\nThat is how you make won-ton and dumpling filling.",

Nutella. Bring pot of water to boil; set mixing bowl w/ egg whites & sugar over it. Whisk mixture over simmering water till slightly warm. Transfer to stand mixer; whip to stiff peaks. Divide.

Pipe peppermint kisses & Christmas trees onto parchment-lined sheet. Bake @ 175F 1-Ã‚_ hrs. Sandwich kisses w/ Nutella before serving. Decorate trees as desired.\n\nHi, I'm Katie Rosehansen, today I'm going to show you how to make peppermint swirl and Christmas tree meringues. These are very fun cookies and very easy to make, although they do take a little bit of time to bake, but they're totally worth it. Here I'm starting with two egg whites in my mixing bowl along with about half a cup of sugar. So that's going right in and using the whisk that I would use in the machine, I'm just going to take this bowl and pop it over a pot of slowly simmering water. \n\nThat's going to be our double boiler, and what that does is helps dissolve the sugar, it warms up the egg whites and it's just going to build a more stable meringue. So I'm just going to take this over to my pot, set it over the double boiler and just slowly whisk until my egg whites start to warm up and my sugar dissolves. It takes about four to five minutes . . . So my egg whites are nice and warm to the touch and my sugar is dissolved. And I'm just going to put this bowl back into my mixer, my finger is stuck. I'm going to put this bowl right back in here and start it up. And you want to whip this until it's really light and fluffy . . . So my meringue is ready. When I pull it out of the mixer, you can see that it just makes these really beautiful peaks. I've gotten it to the point where it's just about medium to stiff peaks, I get this really nice kind of upright kind of swirl going on. So I'm ready to use it, but before I take it out and put it into my piping bags, I'm going to separate half from my Christmas trees and half from my peppermint swirls. \n\nSo I'm going to take a little bit out and the rest I'm going to leave in the mixer. So I have my green food coloring going into this mixer, I'm going to leave that in and that's going to be for our Christmas trees. So I'm using a green gel paste and the beauty of a gel paste is it doesn't add any liquid to your meringue, so you're getting all of that really rich, beautiful color without liquifying your cookies, which is, obviously, a very good thing. So let's beat that in . . . Beautiful. So that's done. Nice and green. And then for our peppermint kisses, first I'm going to add in just a little bit of peppermint extract. Not too much, but just a couple of drops just to add a little flavor, right in. And I'll stir that together first, OK, just to combine. And then I'm going to take a little bit of my red gel paste color, just on a toothpick or a lollipop stick and I'm just going to swirl in a little bit of red. \n\nAnd then go in with my spatula and just barely swirl that color together, so get a little bit of that kind of peppermint colored swirl happening. So these may be two types of cookies but they could bake on the same tray and they'll bake about the same time. So I've got one piping bag that's fitted with a pretty large star tip, that's going to be for our Christmas cookies, our Christmas tree cookies. And I've got a bag with a slightly smaller star tip and that's going to be for our peppermint kisses. So let's fill that one up first, I'm going to take all of my meringue and pop it right into the bag. \n\nTry not to mess with the meringue too much because if you move it around, that swirl that you have now is really just going to turn that whole batter pink and you'll kind of miss that whole point of the peppermint look. So just deck that all down in. Let's do the same for our Christmas tree meringue, just wrap off any excess and it goes right in to my second bag with my large tip . . . OK. So time to paste. We have our large tip here, so that's going to be much larger cookies. But I'm just going to take my bag and hold it straight up and just move it around in a little bit of like, a Christmas tree design. And just do a couple more of those. And I like to leave that big tip at the top, because then when I put decorations on later or if I just want it to be plain like this, it really does look like a Christmas tree with that nice peak happening at the top of the cookie. And obviously if you want more just make more meringue, it's super",

These are good questions and its going to be changing a little bit depending on who your cat is and how old they are, as well as what medical problems your cat might have.  So it's always best to check with your veterinarian.  In general though,  it's great to feed your cat in a way that allows them to eat multiple times per day.  And the reason is, because many cats would be, if left to their own devices, hunting many small meals, sometimes up to 20 per day.  \n\nThat means a huge portion of a normal cat's time budget is taken up with hunting.  And one way that we can simulate that is by providing our cats with either meals that take longer to eat or multiple small meals per day.  If you want to just do one or two meals but want to make them last longer, then using a puzzle toy llike this one is a great option.  There are many different ones out on the market.  \n\nYou can even make them at home from scratch.  But the important thing is that if you're feeding dry food, the dry food goes in the toy so the cat has to work for it just like he would work to hunt to make his meals everyday.  As far as how much you feed your cat, that's going to depend on how many calories are in the cat food that you're feeding.  And that's a great question for your veterinarian.  If your cat's overweight like Essex here,  she's probably going to take fewer calories than another cat that is her same age and roughly her same size because we're going to try and get some weight off of her.  \n\nThat's why, aside from other medical concerns, even if you're just dealing with a cat who might be a little chubbier or a little thin, you wanna talk to your vet about how many calories your cat should have based on the amount of food and the type of food that you're feeding.  Now, for water, the most important thing about water is that cat's should have water available all of the time.  Many cats although not all, prefer fresh running water.  You might actually see that your cat prefers to drink out of the faucet, for instance, or many enjoy drinking right of your glass.  Now, you might not want to share your glass of water with your cat but it's nice to leave one aside where your cat can easily get to it.  Otherwise, there are many water fountains available that many cats enjoy.  \n\nAnd that's how to make sure your cat gets adequate food and water.",

I don't just mean any poop. I mean your bunny's poop. You want to know what normal poop is and what normal pee is because both of these things can help you determine whether your rabbit has a problem or not. \n\nIn this case, Bean is a tiny rabbit, and I can go through his litter box and find a nice normal poop. That's this size for bean. Are there anymore in here? Not right away. You can go through your rabbits litter box at any time and pull out poops and see if they look normal. This is really good to know. You want to know what normal is so that you know what abnormal is. A litter box is a great place to find out what normal is. \n\nYou'll notice here that this litter box also has newspaper in the bottom. I keep newspaper in the bottom of all my litter boxes with hay on top because when I go to look at rabbit's pee, it will be on the newspaper, and I'll be able to inspect in carefully. \n\nWhat's the value of that? The value of that is that when a rabbit urinates, he excretes calcium. It's normal for him to excrete calcium through is kidneys. Calcium is white and chalky looking. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does happen, it will look like this. You see a piece of poop in the middle of this sample, but it's a white, chalky looking excrement. You see it's surrounded by what was once the liquid portion. That's normal for a rabbit.\n\nWhat we worry about for a rabbit is that they can develop a condition called \"bladder sludge,\" which is just what it sounds like. It's like a sandy sediment in the bladder that can be very painful when the rabbit urinates because that sand comes out. That's hard and painful to push out. \n\nWhen rabbits have bladder sludge, there's a lot of controversy on how to deal with that. It's poorly understood. The phenomenon is poorly understood. People used to think that if you took calcium out of the diet or removed as much as possible, fed the rabbit no high-calcium vegetables, that that would help. But what we found out through the years is that this really is a metabolic problem. Changing the diet may not be a good thing, and, in fact, may be a bad thing because if the rabbit's diet has less calcium, the rabbit may start drawing calcium from his bones to meet his calcium needs. He may start excreting the same amount of calcium.\n\nWhat does bladder sludge look like? How is it different from the sample you just saw?\n\nThe sample you just saw was white. When a rabbit starts to develop bladder sludge, the color starts to change a bit and becomes (this is newspaper from of litter box) toward brown. Normal rabbit urine can range from light yellow to dark reddish brown. But when bladder sludge is present, you'll see a staining of the sludge itself with the urine color. It tends to look more brown. \n\nI brought a couple of samples today to give you an impression of what it looks like. Here is a urine sample with very little solid excretion in it. Here is a urine sample from a rabbit that had significant bladder sludge. Look at the difference in color. Look at the sediment you get. This is like sand. Really interesting. If I shake this sample, I can remix it into a suspension, and the whole color will be a light tan. See what happens? See how it compares with the more normal urine color here. I put this one down and bring this one up to show you that this little tube is filled with the sludge that was in this bladder. I decanted off the liquid and let it dry so that you could see the actual sand. You can imagine how painful that would be to pass out of your urinary tract. \n\nYou want to be aware of what normal urine is for your rabbit. The same thing with poop. Normal poop for your rabbit (as I said, you can find poop in the litter box to find what is normal). Also, there's a condition that we in the rabbit world call \"string-of-pearls\" poop. What that means is that during shedding times especially, your rabbits poo",

We're going to talk about rabbit scent glands.  Rabbits have scent glands in their genital area that are usually not visible.  There are two tiny slits on either side of the rectal opening, and you actually have to manipulate the skin to be able to see them.  In those two little tiny glands, you will find a waxy, dark substance, that smells, to me, like a combination of skunk and coffee, and that's a healthy smell.  It really does smell like that.  \n\nA lot of people have told me that they have the same perception.  So, fortunately for us, this is really unusual, fortunately for us, Bean [SP] has not been the best at keeping his scent glands clean lately.  Usually rabbits do a very, very good job of cleaning their own scent glands.  I don't mess with scent glands, or try to clean them, unless I see that the rabbit's having trouble cleaning them.  If he is, then I take a q-tip, like one of these, and I dip it in some tepid water, which we have here, and put it on a towel, and now we're going to do a really personal job here for little Bean.  \n\nLet me show what's going on down here.  He has a little bit of waxy substance.  I'm hoping that you can see this close up.  I'm going to open a scent gland on one side, and you can see where the waxy, tarry substance comes out.  You can use a little bit of oil or water here, to moisten it.  Sometimes it takes several passes to get it soft enough, and you just pull it forward.  Let me get my water over here, since I'm right-handed, and moisten it enough to soften it.  And you can usually work it out with a q-tip, or even scrape it out, if you have long enough fingernails, which I barely do.  Sometimes, a scent gland secretion will become hard enough that it gets a little stuck in there, and you actually can dip the bunny's but into a little pan of water to soften it.  This is a hard secretion, and here it comes.  With short nails it's a little trickier, but there it is.  This is the waxy, lovely, lovely smelling skunk and coffee, and this is a little minor clean-up job in here.  I'm going to check the scent gland on the other side now to see if there's wax in that one, and there is.  See, you haven't been very fastidious lately, have you?  If I had long nails, this would have been off in a flash, but I have short nails.  So, I can't scrape it that way.  And there we are again, a nice piece of wax.  And we're all done.  Bean will clean this up himself, this little residual stuff.  I'll give it a swab here.  I'll dry it off.  And now you're fresh, fresh and clean.  \n\nYou beautiful boy.",

This is a big deal. I see people all the time mishandling the rabbits so tell me. How do I, what's the appropriate way?\n\nAmy:  Okay. Well when you first bring a rabbit into your home you want to give him time to chill. Most people don't do that. They're so excited about getting a rabbit. They want to pick him up. They want to cuddle him. They want to put him on their lap. But these are prey animals and anything grabbing a rabbit is a predator to a rabbit.\n\nMary:  Right.\n\nAmy:  Nothing in nature picks up a rabbit. Not even its own mother in this kind of rabbit.\n\nMary:  Okay.\n\nAmy:  They just don't, they're not easy creatures to handle. That isn't to say that you can't and that isn't to say that they can't be cuddled and all that. But you have to take it a little slowly with them.\n\nMary:  Right.\n\nAmy:  So the best thing to do is set up the rabbit in a good sized cage like a puppy exercise pen. Give him room to move around. Give him a nice big litter box. This is before you handle him. And give him a couple days to chill out and get to know the environment. Get to know what it's like when you walk by.\n\nMary:  Okay.\n\nAmy:  Then, by the time you're ready to handle him, he'll be familiar with you.\n\nMary:  Right.\n\nAmy:  Now, the best thing to do is to sit down in his cage with him, in his puppy pen with him. Read a book. Make a phone call. Text somebody.\n\nMary:  Jeeze!\n\nAmy:  Just do things that have nothing to do with the rabbit so he has the opportunity to come over and sniff at you and climb into your lap if he wants to without hands grabbing him. Many of these animals, especially really little rabbits like this one, have been picked up so often that after awhile they just start to snark at your hands and nip at them because that's the only way they can keep hands away from them.\n\nMary:  Okay.\n\nAmy:  And then we work with them a long time to calm them down. So what you want to do when they're accepting of handling is to take your hand and really slowly, bring it in from the side rather than from the front, rather than . . . \n\nMary:  Because you want to approach on the side always.\n\nAmy:  Where the eye is because . . .\n\nMary:  Where they can't see, their eye is . . .\n\nAmy:  Because they can't see directly in front of themselves. Rabbits have not a true blind spot but a functional blind spot right in front of them. And if you do this with your fist and put them between your eyes and look around you'll get an impression. You won't be able to see anything ahead of you. And that's how rabbits are naturally. So you want to bring your hand in from the side, pause for a minute to give your rabbit a chance to decide whether he wants to be touched. If he doesn't, move away. You move away.\n\nMary:  You mean out of the house?\n\nAmy:  Move out of the house. Just move your hand away.\n\nMary:  Okay.\n\nAmy:  That teaches your rabbit that you're going to respect his space. That if he needs more space and more distance you will respect that. If you don't do that the rabbit will develop a habit of moving away from you to get that distance.\n\nMary:  Okay.\n\nAmy:  Once you persuade him that you will move away when you're respecting his signals you remove his need to move away from you. Which is really great because you want him ultimately to come to you. So when you go to pick him up, what do you do? I'm going to take him out of here. This is a small rabbit and I have rather long fingers so I'm going to pick him up just this way to get him this far and put him here. \n\nBut when you're picking up to carry him the safest way to carry him is what we call the football hold. Never pick up a rabbit by the ears. A lot of people years ago used to do that. Many people still grab them by the scruff and dangle them. But that skin wasn't designed to hold the weight of a rabbit. It just wasn't. It's not comfortable for the rabbit. When you're picking up a rabbit comfortably",

Unfortunately, rabbits who come into shelters don't come with tags on them telling us how old they are and it is very hard to tell the age of a rabbit. There really is no reliable way. Some people look at their teeth, but in fact you can have a young rabbit that has pretty lousy teeth and you can have an older rabbit that has beautiful teeth just as you can with dogs. \n\nWith small breeds of dogs, you can find a young dog with lots of tartar and you can find an older dog with brilliant gleaming white teeth that look like toothpaste ads. Similar with rabbits, their teeth are not a reliable way to tell the age of a rabbit unless the rabbit is extremely young, but other than that when a rabbit comes into a shelter, how do we tell the age? Well, there's two ways that I do. \n\nOne is when they're being spayed or neutered, the toughness of their tissue will often give you a really big clue as to how old they are especially with males. When you're neutering a male, the influence of testosterone over a long period of time like many years will make the tissues very tough and hard to manipulate. Even when I'm injecting the rabbit pre-surgery with his medications, it's hard to get a needle through very tough skin. The skin become almost like a football. That's an older rabbit. \n\nA younger rabbit will have much softer skin and softer tissues for the veterinarian to manipulate during surgery, so that gives you a little bit of a clue. Another thing that I've learned through the years is that there is a relationship between the condition of the rabbits hocks or heels and his age. It's just a personal observation, so take it for what it's worth. I have read this in a book or a text book, anything like that, but I've notice it by caring for many hundreds of rabbits over a very long period of time. \n\nWhen a rabbit is really young, his heels are healthy, pink, beautiful, nice skin, no problem. The heel on a rabbit is like our elbow. The bone is right up against the skin. As a rabbit gets older, the constant pressure on his heel, on his hock, by that bone against the skin starts to change the condition of the hock. So, if you're getting a really young rabbit, you're going to have a fully furred foot with no callous on it. \n\nAs rabbits start to get older, that one spot develops a callous on it. If the rabbit doesn't get enough exercise and is left to sit for long periods of time, this can be either in a wire bottom cage where the wire is cutting into the foot, but it can also be in a flat bottom cage where the rabbit's weight is just constantly on that one spot then you start to get a callous that turns a different color. It starts to get and irritated. Sometimes the flesh actually breaks and the bone starts to come through. That's really dangerous and that opens a path for a serious infection.\n\nSo, I'm going to show you with this little guy, what his hocks look like. We know from his adopter that this rabbit is around seven years old, something like that. He's in great shape and his heels, I think you can get a close up here. See that callous. That is a callous of an older rabbit. It is not inflammed [SP], but it is a dark pink. There's no break in the skin. Nothing looks like it's going to come through, but that's a way that you can check the age of the rabbit as he gets older. When you pick up a rabbit and see that condition, you know that that weights been resting on that spot for a long time. \n\nSo, those are my best tips for aging a rabbit. If you know the rabbits age at the outset, that's great, but don't let that stop you. Don't let your lack of knowledge stop you from adopting a rabbit that you really like because older rabbits need loving families too.",

So one kind of litter we don't have here today is a pelleted newspaper litter.  It's pellets...\n\nAmy:  Yesterday's news!\n\nMary:  ...this size.  Yesterday's News is one brand of it.  You can find other brands as well. It's absorbent and it can pick up the rabbit urine.  It's not inexpensive but a lot of people love it and find it very very useful.  Another kind is called feline pine and that is what this litter looks like and it's a hard pelleted pine, also very useful for absorbing urine.\n\nAmy: And how much do you put in the bottom, just a little bit right?\n\nMary:  Well, funny.  If you're paying for it yourself you tend to scale it down as you go...\n\nAmy: I'll say.  You're carrying it yourself.\n\nMary:  That's right.  A lot of people will start with a lot of the litter and they'll see how fast it goes and how much it costs and they'll start using a thinner and thinner layer.  So whatever.  The idea is for it to absorb...\n\nAmy:  About a quarter...\n\nMary:  Yeah, cover the bottom of the pen. We put a section of newspaper in the bottom of the pens before we put any litter material in because that does two things.  It keeps the pan good longer, you want your pan to be in good shape.  And it also lets you look at the newspaper while you clean the little box.  Because if your rabbit's urine is changing or if there's blood in the urine or if there's something we call bladder sludge which is partially a result of calcium excretion you can actually bring that piece of newspaper in to show your vet, you can say this is what was in my rabbit's litter box this morning.  Very helpful for the vet to see exactly what's going on.  The litter that I personally like best is this.  And it is just plain grass hay. This is timothy hay.  This litter box has a couple sections of newspaper on the bottom and it's filled with hay.  And what I like about hay for litter is a few different things.  It's very comfortable to the rabbits' feet and if you put a lot of hay in the way we have in this litter box, we have it right up to the top...\n\nAmy:  That's what I do, yeah.\n\nMary:  ...yeah and me too. Some people use a polite little handful of hay and that's not really enough.  If you fill it to the top it forms a good cushion and that keeps your rabbit's feet well off the dirty urine covered stuff below.  The urine will drop right through the grass and your rabbit's feet will stay clean and neat and free of urine scald which is really nice.  \n\nAmy:  So you put the newspaper, then you put they hay?\n\nMary:  Newspaper first. \n\nAmy:   Then you can either just put hay or the pellets and then they hay.\n\nMary:  Yeah I don't use the pellets at all, I always use hay.\n\nAmy:  You put the hay on top of the pellets?\n\nMary:  I do.  I do.  It's less expensive for me.  I buy hay from my local stable and I also buy hay on the internet that's really clean and beautiful like this. \n\nAmy:  And then to clean the pan I think you told me once use white vinegar, correct?\n\nMary:  Yeah white vinegar is really useful for rabbit litter because white vinegar neutralizes the urine.  As a matter of fact, when you have rabbit urine to clean up, like a rabbit has an accident on your rug.  If you put white vinegar into a spray bottle and your spritz it a couple of times you can watch it go [noise] kind of foams up...\n\nAmy:  Science project.\n\nMary:  It's like a science project, yeah.  And you just blot it.  You don't rub it, you blot it.  But it will pick up the urine stain right away.  White vinegar is great at cleaning.\n\nAmy:  And how often do you change the litter box?\n\nMary:  it depends on the size of the rabbit, the size of the box, and the rabbit's diet.\n\nAmy:  Okay.\n\nMary:  So depend",

One\nmyth about rabbits that we encounter all the time is that people think\nthey're low maintenance. They are not low maintenance. Once you've taken\ncare of a dog and a rabbit, you will know that a dog takes less time to\ntake care of than a rabbit does, because rabbits need to be cleaned. Their\ncages need to be cleaned. They need to have exercise time outside their\ncage. They need excellent veterinary care. It may take you longer to get to\nthe vet because you can't just go to a dog and cat vet with a rabbit. You\nhave to go to a vet that knows about rabbits. These guys are not low\nmaintenance and that's a major myth.\n\nAnother myth is that they have short lives. I know when I was a child,\npeople used to tell me that rabbits lived a couple years and by the time I\nwas an adult, it had gone up to five or six years. Then it became six or\nseven years, then seven to nine years, then nine or ten years and now we\nare routinely seeing rabbits live ten to twelve years and that's a good\nthing to know before you get a rabbit because this is not a short-lived\nanimal. This animal is going to be with you the same length of time that\nyour larger breeds of dogs are, so that's a major myth to consider.\n\nAnother myth is that rabbits don't need vet care. They do need vet care and\nthey need vet care by vets that know about rabbits. Since rabbits are not\nroutinely studied in veterinary medical school, it can be tricky for owners\nto find what we call a \"rabbit savvy vet\", a vet that has some experience\nwith rabbits and is willing to go to continuing education, workshops,\nseminars, whatever to learn about rabbits. You have to find yourself a vet\nlike that and make sure that your rabbit is cared for by that vet.\n\nAnother myth is that rabbits are happiest out of doors and I think of\noutdoor rabbits as similar to dogs who live in a cage in your backyard, or\nin a doghouse in your backyard. There's really no social interaction. When\na child first gets the rabbit, maybe he's very happy to go outside and take\ncare of the rabbit for a short period of time, but out of sight, out of\nmind and other interests come up and then that rabbit is relegated to an\nisolated spot. It's like keeping somebody in solitary confinement and the\nrabbit also is subject to extremes of weather, to parasites, to predatory\nanimals, so it's a myth that keeping rabbits outdoors is the best way to\nkeep them. In fact, they live long, happy lives, as I said ten to twelve\nyears, is what we're seeing now and some live into their teens even, if\nthey're kept indoors and cared for well.\n\nAnother myth about rabbits is that they love to be picked up and cuddled.\nRabbits actually are ground animals. They live on or under the ground and\nthey feel most comfortable when their feet are on the ground. That isn't to\nsay that you can't pick them up and cuddle them, it's just to say that you\nhave to respect the rabbit's desire to feel safe on the ground. These are\nnot animals that enjoy being toted around all day long by, even adults, but\ncertainly not by kids who don't handle them as well or as easily as adults.\n\n\nAnother common myth is, 'let's get a rabbit because we only have a small\napartment and we don't have a lot of space. Rabbits are small\". In fact,\neven a small rabbit needs plenty of space to exercise. These hind legs are\nreally powerful and they're made for jumping and running. You will never\nget to enjoy the things we see in rabbits if you don't give your rabbit the\nspace to exercise. So, the more room, the better, right? You want to get\nyour rabbit a nice, big exercise pen to live in and then you want to give\nhim out-of-pen exercise time in a nice, safe rabbit-proof area where you've\nremoved electrical wires and houseplants. So the myth of space is a biggie.\nThey need space.\n\nAnother myth is that rabbits smell. In fact, when a rabbit is spayed or\nneutered (spayed f",

RECIPE: Preheat oven to 375F. Beat butter, sugar and molasses in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add egg and beat until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and beat to form a smooth dough. Chill for at least Ã‚_ hour before rolling to Ã‚_ inch thickness. Cut out with a gingerbread man cutter, place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake until golden, 12-14 minutes.\n\nKatie: Hi. I'm Katie Risnasi. Today I'm going to show you how to make Gingerbread Cookie Dough. This is probably my favorite cookie of all of the holiday cookies, so I'm very excited. \n      \nI'm going to start with one stick of softened butter. So I just let the butter sit on the counter until it's nice and soft, about half an hour. And I'm going to start by creaming that, just until it's smooth. And because it's softened that should go very quickly. And it has. It's ready to go.\n      \nSo now I'm going to start adding in my other ingredients. So I have some brown sugar. And this is a third of a cup packed brown sugar. I have a lovely third of a cup of molasses, which is also known as the greatest thing ever. I'm obsessed with molasses. That goes right in. \n      \nAnd now my spices. So I'm starting with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. You could play with that. I've had very good results with pumpkin pie spice, which is a nice blend of spices. But just as much or as little spice as you like. For me, it's the more the better, but it's up to you. A little touch of nutmeg. Some vanilla bean paste, which is my favorite. It's a little better than vanilla extract because you get all those vanilla bean seeds. Salt, very important in desserts, balancing out those sweet flavors, those rich flavors. And also one egg. Going right in. \n\n So I'm going to beat those together first, and then I'm going to add the rest of my dry ingredients. \n\n      OK. So we're ready to add the rest of the ingredients. You can see everything is nice and smooth. And here I have two cups of all purpose flour, going right in. And a half a teaspoon of baking soda. So that's going to be the leavening ingredient in the cookies. You're going to beat those to combine. And this should go very quickly. And I'm going to get ready to roll out my dough. If you have time, you can let the dough chill once it's done for about half an hour until it's nice and firm. But if you don't have time, just get ready by flouring your surface. Not too much flour, but just enough. And I've got my rolling pin ready to go, and we're going to roll out our cookies.  \n\nSo my dough is ready. I'm going to pull all of those extra bits off of the paddle. Take my dough out here. And you can see it's nice and combined. I'm just going to go in with my hand and really pull it together, make sure everything from the bottom of the bowl is mixed in with everything on the top of the bowl, and just that your dough is smooth. And then turn it right out onto your counter. \n\nI'm messy already. But this is a great pliable dough to work with. And you can see once I start to bring it together, it's really nice and firm and smooth, and it's just going to be a pleasure to roll. So I'm just going to re-dust the surface, and go in with my rolling pin. And you don't want to roll these too thin. I like my Gingerbread Men to be a little bit on the chubby side. I'm looking for about a quarter inch thickness. You can go a little less, a little more, depending on your likes or dislikes. But keep in mind, the thinner the cookie, the more likely, especially if you're shipping them, or giving them to someone, and you're transporting them, the thinner they are the more likely that they will break on the way.  \n\nSo we're ready. I'm just going to take my cookie cutter, and a good trick is to always flour your cookie cutter a little bit before you go in to cut the cookies, so this way the cutter won't stick to the dough, and you won't lose any of these arms or legs when you go in. \n      \nBut just press down, all the way down to the edge and lift up. And when I cut, I'm going to cut these as close as possible, so this way I won't have too much dough to bring back together and re-roll afterwards. \n\nOK. So I think that's all I'm going to get without losing arms or legs here. So I'm just going to get rid of the scraps of dough. And again, you could definitely re-roll these. Don't feel like you have to lose those scraps. Those are perfect for rolling again. You'll get even more cookies out of it.\n\nA",

Well, they're wrong. If you know what motivates your cat, you can train it. Now, training with Fria today is going to be a little difficult because she's pretty snooty, but I'm just going to see if she has a reaction to her favorite treat bag. That can be a great place to start for coming when called. \n\nMany cats know the sound of their treat bag and get excited right off the bat when they hear it. So, let's just see if she wakes up. Oh, suddenly we're interested. Well, it's not an ideal time to practice coming when called. It is a good time to reinforce the association that hearing the treat bag means good things. \n\nNow, many cat owners already know about the treat bag effect, but what they don't know is that it's really easy to capitalize on it to teach your cat to come when called. The way to do that is to pair your cat's name with a treat. The great news is since your cat knows the sound of a treat bag or a treat canister, you can build on an already strong association. \n\nSo, in this case, you might say your cat's name and then give them a treat. So, I'll go like this. Fria and then I crinkle the bag which means a treat is coming and then I give her one. Now first, when you're starting this you want to start right by your cat because they don't really know what you're trying to do. Start at a place where cat and you are most likely to be successful. So, rinse and repeat. Fria, crinkle, crinkle and then give a treat. \n\nNow, when you're ready to start working on coming when called you can begin working from a distance. I'm not going to do this with Fria today because she might walk right off the table if she happened to get up, but what you would do is the same type of behavior. Say the cat's name, crinkle the bag and as soon as they come over give a treat. Eventually, the name that you give your cat for this exercise will become as powerful as the treat bag and you'll see that when you give the sound of your cat's name that your cat comes running for that treat. \n\nOver time you can stop using food and use scratches or other positive attention that your cat enjoys as a reinforcer. Just remember that it's not normal for cats to come when called in the wild, so it's definitely a behavior that's worth paying for. That's how you teach your cat to come when called.",

She has collaborated with the likes of Saweetie, Doja Cat, G Flip and Baker Boy. Her imposing & stylistic form has accumulated over 20 million streams across her impressive catalogue & praise from music/culture tastemakers Afropunk, Acclaim, NME, Sniffers and VICE. She has also delivered dynamic live shows at major festivals including SXSW, The Great Escape, Listen Out & Laneway and has shared the stage with international artists including Stormzy, Kehlani & Genesis Owusu. Signed to Say Less (a joint venture w/ Warner Music Australia) JessB continues to push the boundaries of her sound & songwriting finesse. She has cemented her status as a reckoning force on a global music stage.\n"

(Got that definition from wikipedia lol it's not my own). But if you've ever had someone play with your hair or draw on your back, which I'm sure you have, you would have experienced this feeling!! (It is the bessstttt) So my goal on this channel is to give you those brain tinglezzz and help you sleep 😴 \n\n📩 Business enquiries: marketing@hunnibeeasmr.com \n"

If in the end it’s just me and God, like I’m Christian again \nYea, Slim bring the beat in\nBefore my dad left this earth\nHe made sure I took on every quality I didn’t want\nI was supposed to die at birth\nGave me a chance and I fucked it up give me another one\nI’ve been running from secrets I hid as a kid and I never confronted them \nI just called mom,\nSaid I forgive her for not being there when I needed one \nI’m coming back just let me go\nI’m coming back just let me go, yea \nI’m coming back, just let me go\nI’m coming back, don’t let me go \nWho am I when the music stops\nAnd the character that I’ve been playing is really just broken and fucking lost\nI swear I’ve been telling you over and over again in all these songs\nBut they don’t hear nothing I’m writing cause they’re too busy tryna write me off \nAnd they go on and on and on\nIt’s funny cause if we just sat and talked\nYou’d see that it’s just hard for me to be vulnerable cause I blocked it off\nI got trust issues, growing up no one was there to hear what I thought\nMy heart was broken like my ribs as a kid when me and my father fought \nYea, I’m medicating with something I cannot pronounce but it’s what the doctor gave me\nRehab patient with a pen and some paper the psychiatrist keeps evaluating\nHow can I live with the fact that my hand wasn’t on her stomach when we lost the baby \nI don’t got no one to turn to cause everyone’s dead in my life that was tryna raise me \nSearching for someone to tell me who I really am, I don’t know when I look in the mirror\nConstantly dreading the day that the audience might not be screaming for me anymore \nThe feeling of dying alone and not leaving anything behind is my biggest fear \nKiss the person that I love as if I’m never coming back after I leave out the door \nI’m coming back, just let me go (Feeling like)\nI’m coming back, just let me go, yea \nI’m coming back, just let me go\nI’m coming back, don’t let me go \nI’m coming back, just let me go\nI’m coming back, just let me go, yea \nI’m coming back, just let me go\nI’m coming back, don’t let me go\n\n#mgk #DontLetMeGo #MachineGunKelly",

                "description": "In 2024 they said we'd have flying cars. We still don't, but we are now one step closer. Apparently this is NOT the world's first jet board, BUT it is without question the most successful / fastest. My top speed on this board so far was 45MPH which was horrifying. This thing will absolutely crush any electric skateboard, scooter, or bike you can buy online today. Overall this jet board is completely impractical, but F***ing awesome. Only in America. \n\nShout out to Nick Clark @LiveLearnProjects  the genius engineer behind the assembly of this Jet board. Follow his YouTube channel if you want to see more stuff!\n\n#usa #hellyeah #skate #jet",

It is widely understood within the community that the real cause of death was the use of deadly and illegal steroids - and this wasn’t an isolated incident.\n\nFor many lower class kids in Pakistan today, bodybuilding has become an obsession and a route out of the abject poverty in which they were born. But time spent at the gym brings them into contact with unscrupulous actors feeding off their dreams, and supplying them with steroids.\n\nVICE World News is in Pakistan to explore firsthand the obsessive culture of bodybuilding among frustrated lower working-class men and how, after investing more than they can afford in this competitive and unforgiving sport, they end up gambling with their lives for a shot at wealth and fame.\n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more like this: \n\nInside Pakistan's Morgues\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYNzQTKSoGc&t=2s \n\nThe Heroin Pill Sparking Deadly Turf Wars\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwH6os1Y1p4&t=728s\n\nSouth Africa’s Descent into Chaos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cew-BnjA_q4 \n\nProduced & Directed by Saad Zuberi \n(Insta: https://www.instagram.com/zuberisaad/ | Twitter: https://twitter.com/saadmzuberi)\nDOP: Haider Ali\nEditor: Husain Qaizar Yunus\nAssociate Editor: Nina Zehri\nAssistant Producer: Sharjeel Arshad\n\nHelp keep VICE News’ fearless reporting free for millions by making a one time or ongoing contribution here. - https://vice.com/contribute\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News",

Now, the war is a battle of positions, with the Ukrainian forces on the defensive in the Donbas region, trying to slow the Russian advance down.

With the neighborhood’s only grocery store closed for the foreseeable future and the loss of 10 of its community members, activists and volunteers spent weeks filling the void by identifying the needs of the people, knocking on doors, organizing food giveaways and speaking to the city’s youth.\n\nBut many of the issues they saw weren’t just a result of the recent tragedy, but of decades of neglect, disinvestment, and racism. VICE News visited East Buffalo to see how the community is dealing with the ripple effects of the racist attack that changed this predominantly Black neighborhood forever.\n\nHelp keep VICE News’ fearless reporting free for millions by making a one time or ongoing contribution here. - https://vice.com/contribute\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News",

Poverty and coercion force many young men into a life of crime where the only ways to escape are incarceration or death. \n\nBut amidst the carnage, there is a glimmer of hope - the “91” is a group of former gang lords turned pastors, who offer salvation to gang members who want to leave the criminal life. Their standing in the gang community, forged out of years of service and hard-fought respect, mean that only they can vouch for criminals looking to trade crime for the path of God.\n\nBy recording videos of these gangsters in repentance - that follow a tight script and are then shared with the higher ranks of the gangs for approval - they are saving hundreds of lives that Brazilian institutions overlook. This is the story of the “91”.\n\nDirecting and DOP: Mauricio Monteiro Filho and Avener Prado\nSoundtrack: Gustavo Monteiro\nEditing: Mauricio Monteiro Filho and Diego Arvate\nProducers: Charlie Rosser and Matt Shea\n\nCheck out the VICE World News playlist for global reporting you won't find elsewhere: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw613M86o5o4S3BXgi3bCiIVuopQxIMgV\n\nWatch more like this: \n\nThe Rise of Brazil’s Biggest Prison Gang \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI5QLqYcZ0E \n\nThe World's Most Dangerous Drug Wars \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2YfG7NKvoU \n\nHelp keep VICE News’ fearless reporting free for millions by making a one time or ongoing contribution here. - https://vice.com/contribute\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News",

They were put in touch with twin boys Charlie and Sam who accused Jerry Harris of soliciting nude photos, and with their permission they shared their story that would change the world of cheerleading forever. \n\nHelp keep VICE News’ fearless reporting free for millions by making a one time or ongoing contribution here. - https://vice.com/contribute\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News",

He kept an eye on the White House and let the world know what was happening during elections. Having such a successful career made it seem like he had a perfect life. He was earning awards left and right. Every time he retired from one program, he found another to join. His legacy \n\nBrit’s wife had her own issues to deal with. She came from an alcoholic family and had to overcome her addiction. Reading the Bible and committing to God helped her through the process. Then, the family was faced with an even bigger tragedy. It was the kind of event that can shake a family and ruin it forever. Their son Sandy took his own life. He shot himself after getting released from jail. Brit got a call with the news and was overcome with grief. \n\nHe didn’t expect to receive any messages because political commentators blended into the background. Despite that, he received endless letters of sympathy. He’s very thankful for them, but they only provided minimal healing. He needed something else to rely on. A strong faith was the only way for the family to get back on their feet again. Brit recommitted himself to Christ. He started a Bible study group with his colleagues. They made something positive out of the tragedy. \n\nLike and subscribe to FactsVerse for more on the world’s most famous political commentators.

Majors experienced a string of high-profile relationships, starting with his marriage to actress Kathy Robinson, with whom he had his first son, Lee Majors Jr. His second marriage to Charlie’s Angels star Farrah Fawcett made them Hollywood’s “it” couple of the ‘70s. Later, he married Karen Velez, a former Playboy Playmate, with whom he had three more children, before finally finding stability with his fourth wife, Faith, who remains his partner today. \n\nHis journey wasn’t without challenges, facing health scares and the strains of fame, but Majors continues to inspire fans. Today, he lives a quieter life, cherishing his legacy and embracing the role of family man. His enduring popularity speaks volumes, as fans of all ages discover his work and remember his characters fondly. His legacy, both as an actor and as a resilient figure, transcends generations, showing that heroes come in many forms, on-screen and off.

                "description": "Karl Rove’s life and career reveal the complexities of a man driven by a singular dedication to political strategy, often at the expense of his personal relationships. From his early days in the Republican Party, Rove’s commitment to winning and his strategic brilliance set him apart. Known as “The Architect” behind George W. Bush’s election campaigns, he orchestrated victories through meticulous planning and data-driven tactics, reshaping American politics in the process. Yet behind the public figure lay a personal life marked by sacrifice. \n\n▬Contents of this video▬\n00:00 - Intro\n00:49 - Key Role in the Bush Administration\n04:14 - Marriage to Valerie Wainwright and First Divorce\n05:29 - Marriage to Darby Hickson and Family Life\n07:56 - After the Divorce\n09:23 - Outro\n\nLike this content?

His second marriage to Darby Hickson, which lasted over two decades, offered him more stability, but it too unraveled under the relentless demands of public life. As Rove rose to prominence, his responsibilities increased, culminating in his influential role within the Bush administration and his involvement in high-profile controversies, such as the Valerie Plame affair. Rove once remarked, “Politics isn’t a game for the faint-hearted,” a sentiment that underscored the personal toll his career exacted. The eventual end of his marriage to Darby marked a turning point, leading Rove into a period of reflection. \n\nHis later years found him less directly involved in politics, instead focusing on media commentary and mentoring young conservatives. Reflecting on his own journey, he has admitted that finding balance was challenging, a sobering realization from someone whose ambition left an indelible mark on American politics. In his public commentary, Rove now displays a tempered tone, suggesting an awareness of the sacrifices he made along the way. Today, Rove’s legacy is one of immense influence but also one that illustrates the high personal costs of a life spent in the political spotlight. His journey serves as both a caution and a testament to the power of unwavering dedication.\n\nKarl Rove Divorced His Wife Immediately After This Happened",

Although she had high-profile relationships with figures like Eric Clapton, Owen Wilson, and Lance Armstrong, Crow chose not to marry, embracing a life of autonomy instead. Her love life, often in the public eye, taught her that personal happiness could be found outside traditional paths. She has been engaged multiple times, but marriage never felt essential to her. Instead, she fulfilled her desire for family by adopting two sons, Wyatt and Levi, a decision that brought her immense joy. \n\nCrow’s health challenges, including a breast cancer diagnosis in 2006 and a benign brain tumor in 2011, deepened her appreciation for life and underscored her commitment to living authentically. Now in her 60s, Crow is at peace with her choices, balancing a successful music career with the responsibilities of motherhood. Her life serves as an example of living authentically and finding happiness outside of societal expectations. She is a reminder that fulfillment is personal, and happiness often comes from living on one’s terms. “I’m grateful I didn’t get married,” she has said, a sentiment that captures her journey of self-reliance and contentment.\n\nSheryl Crow Has Never Married, Now We Know Why",

                "description": "Linda Ronstadt’s legacy extends far beyond her impressive musical career, making her one of the most influential and respected artists of her generation. As one of the first female rock stars, she broke through barriers in a male-dominated industry, demonstrating that women could not only succeed but also dominate across multiple genres. Her career, which spanned rock, country, pop, and traditional Mexican music, showcased her unparalleled versatility and fearlessness in pursuing different musical directions. \n\n▬Contents of this video▬\n00:00 - Intro\n00:52 - Early Life\n02:19 - Career Achievements and Highlights\n03:45 - Linda Ronstadt’s Personal Life: Family and Children\n05:33 - Relationships and Why She Never Married\n07:12 - Health Challenges and Retirement\n09:10 - Outro\n\nLike this content?

This blend of personal and professional risk-taking helped make her a cultural icon. Reflecting on her journey, Ronstadt has said, “I never saw the point in limiting myself.”\n\nIn addition to her trailblazing career, Ronstadt made profound contributions by bringing traditional Latin music to mainstream audiences and preserving cultural heritage. She proudly embraced her Mexican roots, using her platform to celebrate and introduce this music to a wider audience, bridging cultural gaps in the process. Despite stepping away from music after her diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease, Ronstadt continues to inspire with her strength and resilience. \n\nWhile the illness took away her ability to sing, it did not diminish her spirit. “I had a long turn at the trough. I was lucky,” she reflected, finding peace in her remarkable journey. Her courage in sharing her struggles with the world and her enduring advocacy for the arts and culture make her legacy one that transcends music. Linda Ronstadt’s impact is one of both artistic innovation and personal courage, leaving an indelible mark on the music world and beyond.\nMeet Linda Ronstadt's 2 Children, She Still Has No Husband",

They changed her life forever. Both her husband’s parents died within days of each other at separate nursing homes. They weren’t allowed to see them or hold a funeral because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Janice blames the tragedy primarily on Andrew Cuomo’s nursing home policies. He allowed thousands of infected patients to be brought in. \n\nShe lost all respect for the governor. The truth about how many patients died because of his policies is unknown. He even allegedly tried to silence Janice’s attempts to bring the story out by saying she was only reliable for the weather. That didn’t stop her from using her platform to get the story out. His response and sexual abuse allegations only encouraged her efforts. She was glad when Andrew finally resigned.\n\nJanice is also fighting a personal battle. She has a condition that is common but not well-known.\nMultiple sclerosis or MS causes lesions on her brain and spine. It’s as unpredictable as the weather, leaving her incapacitated one day and feeling fine the next. Changes to her diet and exercise routine help lessen her symptoms. She still comes to work, but her priorities have shifted to taking care of her family. No matter what, she’s not letting anything stop her from living the life she wants. She’s worked too hard to get where she is.\n\nLike and subscribe to FactsVerse for more secrets of the stars of Fox News.

From her early days as a progressive Democrat to her current role as a conservative commentator and Trump supporter, Gabbard has continually defied expectations. This video delves into a pivotal moment in her personal life - her divorce from her first husband, Eduardo Tamayo - and explores how this experience shaped her political career.\n\nWe examine the strain that military service placed on Gabbard's first marriage and how it influenced her stance on foreign policy. We also look at her subsequent political career, her second marriage, and her dramatic departure from the Democratic Party in 2022. Finally, we discuss her recent endorsement of Donald Trump and her new role on his transition team.\n\nThis video offers a unique perspective on how personal experiences can shape political views and careers. Whether you agree with Gabbard's political evolution or not, her story provides valuable insights into the intersection of personal life and public service in American politics.\n\nThroughout the video, we explore the complexities of Gabbard's background, including her upbringing in Hawaii and her embrace of the Hindu faith. We delve into her military service and how it not only affected her marriage but also profoundly influenced her views on foreign intervention. We examine the criticism she's faced from both sides of the political aisle and how she's responded to it. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of her political transformation, what it might mean for the future of American politics, and how it reflects changing dynamics within both major parties. By the end, viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of Gabbard's unique place in the American political landscape.\n\nTulsi Gabbard Finally Announces the Reason for Her Divorce",

The Cybertruck looked good on paper 5 years ago - but what we got delivered in 2024 is far different than what was promised. I highly recommend that *no one* ever tows anything besides a lawn mower with their Cybertruck. A steel hitch bolted to a cast aluminum frame is extremely dangerous.\n\nOf course you can always get your own cybertruck HERE: https://ts.la/zack10701\nOr (even better) a Rivian HERE: https://rivian.com/configurations/list?reprCode=ZACK1594426\n\nI own a Tesla Cybertruck, a Rivian R1T and a Ford Lightning.

To this end, Aquila travels to northern Britain with a Celtic slave, Esca (Jamie Bell from Billy Elliot and King Kong), who owes him his life. Both venture beyond Hadrian's Wall to Caledonia, where they are confronted by Pictish tribes. Aquila is determined to find the emblem of the legion that disappeared in Pictish territory along with his father, the Roman eagle. During his journey, Aquila meets a local tribe, the \"seal people\", and becomes their prisoner. Thanks to Esca, who pretended to betray him in order to deceive the seal people, Marcus recovers the eagle and the two men flee. The \"seal people\" set out in pursuit. A last battle takes place, Marcus has the unexpected support of the survivors of the 9th legion and, in company of Esca who became his friend, he can bring back the eagle to Rome. He is then offered to re-found the legion.\n\nCredits: © 2011 Universal Pictures.\nBinge Society is a licensed partner and shares the rights to this clip with Universal Pictures.",

As Qualen struggles to regain control, Gabe attaches the chopper's winch to the top of a metal ladder running down the mountainside while Hal shoots at the chopper until it loses power and falls. It pulls the top part of the ladder off its attachments and ends up dangling on the side of the cliff. Gabe, who had taken refuge on the ladder to avoid Qualen's gunfire, falls and lands on the chopper, where he and Qualen engage in a fistfight. As the rest of the ladder gives way, Gabe jumps off and grasps the cliff side while the chopper, with Qualen in it, falls 4,000 feet and explodes on impact. Hal and Jessie toss Gabe a rope and help him to the top.\n\nBINGE MORE:  https://youtu.be/0k_gsei9cAk \n\nCredits:  © 1993 Cliffhanger B.V.

It's like a new era funk and I'm here for it. This lyric video that Alan made is the second official lyric video for the song and it couldn't be more on point (I actually like it more than the official).

I have been replaying this song since Anyma's manager showed it to me a few weeks ago. The visuals are also completely next level and I know some Proximity fans will be surprised by this but give it a few listens and I think you'll fall in love. Enjoy!\n\n\"Leading electronic producers and composers Anyma (from Tale Of Us) and Chris Avantgarde join forces to create a new collaboration “Consciousness”. \n\nAnyma’s first vocal single of 2022 follows  his widely celebrated, Kate Bush inspired single “Running,” which has  been a cross genre staple within electronic music since its release back in late 2021.\n\nBy combining Anyma’s dominant synthesisers and Chris Avantgarde’s scoring talents the track balances an eerie robotic vocal, detailing the  definition of consciousness itself - atop frenetic drums and robust synths. Anyma has been busy touring as one half of the esteemed techno duo Tale Of Us, where “Consciousness” has become the opening track that sets the vivid scene that Anyma and Tale Of Us are known for. Anyma will continue to tour extensively this year with a residency at Ibiza’s famed super-club Hï, with countless global appearances this summer such as EDC Las Vegas, Tomorrowland, and many more.\n\n“Consciousness” releases via Afterlife / EVA DAO on May 18, 2022.\n\nAnyma & Chris Avantgarde - Consciousness (AL066)\"\n\n⚡Copyright Free Music!⚡\nhttp://bit.ly/CopyrightFreePRX\n\n#anyma #taleofus #afterlife #visualizer",

It's crazy that it's still just as good today as it was in 2012 (can't believe it was released almost 10 years ago). Virtual Riot did this \"sad\" remix of Clarity and the intro is beautiful and the two drops. I uploaded this record on Proximity chill a couple years ago but I thought it would be fitting to also share this with you all even though it's more downtempo. Hope you enjoy and happy holidays! :)\n\n•Zedd:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/zedd\nhttp://facebook.com/Zedd\n\n•Virtual Riot:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/virtual-riot\nhttps://www.facebook.com/virtualriotmusic\n\nPicture by: Aenami:\nhttps://www.artstation.com/aenamiart\n\n⚡Copyright Free Music!⚡\nhttp://bit.ly/CopyrightFreePRX\n\n#zedd #clarity #remix #virtualriot #sad",

I love love how different and unpredictable the entire series was. From the actors, to the games, and even the eerie music, it's hard to imagine it any other way.

He estimates that he trafficked over $50 million worth of illegal steroids. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Sandhu operated a steroid-trafficking network that sourced its supply from Karachi, Pakistan, and transported it via routes including the Netherlands, France, and Spain to the United Kingdom by bribing airport security. He was arrested during a smuggling run and sentenced to 4 ½ years in the Fontcalent correctional facility in Alicante, Spain, one of Europe’s most infamous prisons.\n\nSandhu speaks with Business Insider about the underground anabolic-steroid market, explaining how testosterone and other performance-enhancing drugs make their way to street dealers, local gyms, and online platforms. He highlights the harsh prison sentences imposed in some countries and advocates for steroid use to be handled as a medical issue.\n\nSince his release from prison, Sandhu has written two books, \"From King of Karachi to Lockdown in the Costa Del Crime\" and \"Self-Made, Dues Paid.\" He now runs a CBD company.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://chetsandhu.com/ \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:34 - The Suppliers\n03:27 - The Factories\n07:02 - The Smuggling\n10:27 - The Market\n13:22 - The Money\n15:12 - The Doses\n18:05 - The Bust\n19:20 - The Jail\n24:49 - The Aftermath\n26:15 - The Future\n28:31 - Credits\n\nMORE HOW CRIME WORKS VIDEOS:\nHow Cults Actually Work (Nxivm) | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bb1EtTnvaw\nHow The Irish Mob Actually Works | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9cMiFV0VRs\nHow NYC Street Gangs (East Coast Bloods) Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/S1b9-QdvUYM\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#crime #crimenews #insider \n\nInsider's mission is to inform and inspire. \n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/\nInsider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/insider\nInsider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/insider\nInsider on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thisisinsider\nInsider on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Insider/2708030621\nInsider on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@insider\n\nHow Illegal Steroids Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider",

Macy.\n\nHe breaks down how a predator could take down an Ankylosaurus, how an Ankylosaurus defended itself with its tail, and the differences between Pteranodons and other flying dinosaurs like the Dimorphodon in \"Jurassic World,\" starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard.\n\nHe explains why some dinosaurs with sharp claws couldn't outclimb humans and how others could deliver devastating headbutts in \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\"\n\nFinally, he does a deep dive on the many feathered dinosaurs featured in \"Jurassic World: Dominion.\"\n\nDave Hone is a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London.

                "description": "Guillermo del Toro’s Netflix adaptation of “Pinocchio” breathes new life into the over-century-old art form of stop-motion animation. The film achieved a new level of expressiveness in its animated puppets by marrying traditional stop-motion techniques with newer technologies. \n\nWe spoke with “Pinocchio” puppet fabrication supervisor Georgina Hayns and animation supervisor Brian Leif Hansen about the labor of love behind the film.\n\nHayns and Leif Hansen are world-renowned stop-motion artists who brought their expertise to the three-year undertaking that was “Pinocchio.” Previously, Hayns supervised character fabrication for “Kubo and the Two Strings” (2016), “The Boxtrolls” (2014), “ParaNorman” (2012), and “Coraline” (2009). Leif Hansen was an animator on “Missing Link” (2019), “Fantastic Mr. Fox” (2009), and “Frankenweenie” (2012).\n\nBoth artists worked on Tim Burton’s “Corpse Bride” (2005), which was pioneering for its use of geared heads to express nuanced emotion in stop-motion characters, a technique adopted in “Pinocchio.” Meanwhile, other stop-motion films like “Coraline” laid the groundwork for the implementation of 3D printing technology in “Pinocchio.” Del Toro’s team built and expanded upon all of these tools and more to light up the lived-in world of “Pinocchio.”\n\nFor more from Georgina Hayns and ShadowMachine:\nhttps://www.shadowmachine.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/shadowmachine_official/\nFor more from Brian Leif Hansen: https://www.brianleifhansen.com/\nFor more from Savannah Joy Steiner: https://www.instagram.com/savanimationz/\n\n00:00-0:50: Mechanics of Spazzatura\n0:50-2:45: Mechanical Puppets\n2:45-4:50:  Making a 3D-Printed Pinocchio\n4:50-7:05: Customizing Each Puppet\n7:05-8:28: Animating & Rigging Motion\n8:28-8:57: Adding VFX\n8:57-9:53: Costumes & Cloth\n9:53-10:38: Labor of Love\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Disney's Animated Landscapes Became More Lifelike | Movies Insider | Insider \nhttps://youtu.be/L_Zx8j1HYzA\nHow Moving Cars And Vehicles Are Faked In Movies & TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/NSQDlTupArk\nHow ‘Rings of Power’ Created Its Extreme Ocean Storm | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/cEC16VtrTfw\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#StopMotion #Animation #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "To pull off some of the most sensational aerial stunts ever seen in a movie, Tom Cruise trained the cast of “Top Gun: Maverick” (2022) to fly while the crew captured footage from the cockpit using a groundbreaking Imax camera setup. \n\nTo be safely involved in the highway chase in “The Batman” (2022), Robert Pattinson and Colin Farrell either rode in camera cars driven by stunt drivers or sat on a rig in front of LED screens. Then, with “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” (2022)  and “Thor: Love and Thunder” (2022), Marvel movies pushed technological boundaries, while their stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Hemsworth, and Christian Bale could be hoisted into the air thanks to wires and tuning forks. \n\nFor “Bullet Train” (2022), the crew built moving train-car models on set, and Brad Pitt was later placed into a CG-built exploding train. But the real surprise breakout action film of the year was “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022). Using specially created props, the film gave Ke Huy Quan a killer fanny pack. And thanks to hidden wirework, Jamie Lee Curtis could fly in the air and Michelle Yeoh could look like she was delivering powerful blows with just one pinky.\n\nOwn “The Batman” now on digital and 4K ultra HD. \nRising Sun Pictures:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@rspvfx1500\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rspvfx/\nhttps://www.rsp.com.au/\nDNEG:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@DNEGVFX\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dneg/\nhttps://www.dneg.com/\nCC Ice:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cc_ice_stunts/\nPanorama SFX:\nhttp://www.panoramasfx.se/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/panoramasfx/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/panoramaworkshop/\nhttps://vimeo.com/user23951566\nAdam Pescott:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/adampescott/\n\nTop Gun: Maverick 00:32\nThe Batman 01:57\nUncharted 03:03\nThor: Love and Thunder 03:53\nDr. Strange 05:00\nNope 06:18\nTriangle of Sadness 07:04\nEverything Everywhere 08:33\nMoonfall 09:26\nBullet Train 10:21\nNorthman 11:09\nElvis 12:17\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Underwater Scenes Are Shot For Movies And TV Shows | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/QxX95Cx_YCE\nWhat 8 More Horror Movies Looked Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/5hrp26ydmBk\nWhat 12 Of The Rock’s Stunts Looked Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/lMVG9goigak\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Behindthescenes #Movies #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

For him, that has meant a lot of preparation, like when he played a rescue pilot in \"San Andreas\" (2015). \n\nThanks to clever camerawork, stunt coordination, and visual effects, he was able to leap off a motorcycle in \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\" (2017), get hit by a bull in Netflix's \"Red Notice\" (2021), and redirect a torpedo in \"The Fate of the Furious\" (2017), which made for one of the most memorable moments in the \"Fast and the Furious\" franchise. \n\nAnd his dedication to his workouts as well as the fight training skills he picked up as a wrestler benefited him in roles like \"Hercules\" (2014), \"Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw\" (2019), and \"Black Adam\" (2022).\n\nTanoai Reed: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/samoanstuntman/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Medical Scenes Are Faked For Movies & TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/7cABTivGb9o\nHow Actors Transform Their Bodies For Superhero Roles | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/F6bbB81izug\nHow Hyperrealistic Wigs Are Made For 4K Movies & TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/WpTe2fuTJWY\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#TheRock #DwayneJohnson #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "From Millie Bobby Brown's buzz cut in \"Stranger Things\" to Ana de Armas' Marilyn Monroe curls in \"Blonde\" (2022), movies and TV shows have had to transform character via wigs for decades. To find out how a master wigmaker designs full heads of hair for movies and TV shows, we visited the New York and Beverly Hills studios of Wigmaker Associates with founder Rob Pickens.\n\nIn the era of 4K and HD cameras, the standard for film and TV wigs has never been higher. Digital cameras are significantly less forgiving than film, meaning that hairlines must appear seamless and lace fronts must be finer. Rob's team shows us how they trace the intricacies of actors' hairlines and growth patterns to create wigs that mimic nature. He explains how he worked with \"Stranger Things\" hair department head Sarah Hindsgaul to make make the short-haired Eleven wig sit invisibly on Millie Bobby Brown's scalp, using techniques such as point knotting and an ingenious application process. And having worked on period pieces like \"Pose,\" \"The Gilded Age,\" and \"American Crime Story,\" Rob discusses how historical settings shape the color and texture of his wigs.\n\nRob also breaks down how factors like camera and lighting influence wigs' coloring, from Amanda Seyfried's blond in \"Mank\" (2020) to Eddie's ash brown in \"Stranger Things.\" He  worked with hair department head Jaime Leigh McIntosh to perfect the red of Olivia Wilde's wig in \"Don't Worry Darling\" (2022) and the multi-dimensional color of Michelle Pfeiffer's Betty Ford wigs for \"The First Lady\" (2022). Meanwhile, on \"Pam & Tommy\" (2022), lead hair designer Barry Lee Moe incorporated four shades of blonde into Rob's wigs to make Pam Anderson's signature platinum pop on camera. \n\nWigmaker Associates' other creations include Tom Hardy's Scarface wigs for \"Capone\" (2020) and Tom Hanks' Mr. Rogers wigs for \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" (2019). The studio has also built wigs for Will Ferrell in \"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\" (2020), Jamie Lee Curtis in \"Halloween\" (2018), and Billie Eilish in her \"Xanny\" video (2019).\n\nFor more from Rob Pickens and Wigmaker Associates:\nhttps://www.wigmakerassociates.com/ \nhttps://www.instagram.com/wigmakerassociates/ \n\nFor more from Jaime Leigh McIntosh:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jaimeleigh.hair/ \n\nFor more from Barry Lee Moe: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/barryleemoe/\n\nFor more from Sarah Hindsgaul:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sarahhindsgaul/ \n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Fake Animals Are Made For Movies And TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/WAyXSUfgYws\nWhy It’s So Hard For Foley Artists To Make Footstep Sounds | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/QBDU3pJaU6c\nHow Cars Are Destroyed For Movies & TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/eMgMlNdREew\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Wigs #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "Every movie and TV show you love wouldn’t be what it is without the skilled craftspeople who bring it to life. And some work that happens behind the scenes is not what you’d expect. There are special effects artists who design fake teeth to look bad, which is how Austin Powers got his signature smile. \n\nMovement coach Polly Bennett helped performers like Rami Malek and Austin Butler imitate the movements of musicians Freddie Mercury and Elvis Presley in “Bohemian Rhapsody” (2018) and “Elvis” (2022). There are prop makers who specialize in edible objects as well as silent bags and ice cubes to minimize any sound that could ruin a great take. \n\nSome of the most crucial and unexpected roles come after a movie is shot. For instance, many of the visual effects artists at Barnstorm VFX focused on creating digital extras to fill out the “Ted Lasso” stadium, while some of Disney’s most talented animators have spent over a decade perfecting and advancing animated hair in everything from “Moana” (2016) to “Encanto” (2021).\n\nGary Archer:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/teeth_by_archer/\n\nDominic Mombrun:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bitemakers/\nhttps://www.bitemakers.co.uk/\n\nPolly Bennett:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/pollyannabennett/?hl=en\nhttps://www.pollybennettmovement.com/\n\n0:31 Breakdown Artist\n1:32 Edible Prop Maker\n2:54 Dental Technician\n3:52 Silent Prop Maker\n5:16 Digital Crowd Supervisor\n6:23 Movement Coach\n7:46 Roboticist\n8:50 Invisible Stunt Performers\n9:37 Scream Artist\n10:36 Previs Artist\n11:26 Hair Animator\n12:40 Cockroach Trainer\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Frozen-In-Time Scenes Are Shot For Movies And TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/OrgbZD2sRnU\nHow ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ Dinosaur VFX Evolved from ‘Jurassic Park | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/8iQMGo_IjU4\nHow 13 Props Are Made For Movies And TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/bEIosxtZAR4\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Specialeffects #Hollywood #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "As seen in the likes of “Spider-Man” (2002), “The Matrix” (1999), and “The French Dispatch” (2021), movies can make scenes look like they’re frozen in time. The first step is shooting at a higher frame rate to slow the action down as much as possible. \n\nIn “X-Men: Days of Future Past” (2014) and “X-Men: Apocalypse” (2016), the crew used a camera capable of shooting at 3,000 frames per second to capture time standing still as Quicksilver runs at superspeed. \n\nIn postproduction, digital tools allowed animators to retime a live-action shot so Quicksilver looks like he’s the only one moving, while stabilizing any subtle movements on any characters who were supposed to be completely still. \n\nBut movies can also approach these scenes practically. For the Oscar-nominated “The Worst Person in the World” (2021), prop master Hedda Virik created a fake coffee stream, built stands to hold up bicycles mid-ride, and employed stuffed dogs.\n\nRising Sun Pictures:\nhttps://www.rsp.com.au/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN05FccYcWXY4Y5P16oBWQ\n\nHedda Virik:\nhttp://www.heddavirik.com/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Dinosaurs Have Evolved from ‘Jurassic Park’ to ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iQMGo_IjU4\nHow 13 Props Are Made For Movies And TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEIosxtZAR4\nHow Flying Scenes Are Shot For Movies And TV | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Ey8WGtUcE\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#FrozenInTime #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "We trace the evolution of dinosaur effects in the \"Jurassic\" movies, from the Tyrannosaurus rex in the paddock scene from \"Jurassic Park\" (1993) to the feathered dinosaurs and Giganotosaurus introduced in \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" (2022).\n\nWe spoke to legends like Dennis Muren, who was in charge of Industrial Light & Magic's full-motion CG dinosaurs for \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" (1997), and Phil Tippett, the pioneering stop-motion artist behind Tippett Studios and dinosaur supervisor on \"Jurassic Park.\"\n\nJean Bolte, a texture artist at ILM, shares what it was like to witness the initial CG T. rex tests, which were so groundbreaking they convinced Steven Spielberg to go the digital route for his dinosaurs. Matt Winston, cofounder of Stan Winston School and a puppeteer on the original \"Jurassic Park,\" breaks down the revolutionary mold-making process and hydraulic technology used on the T. rex animatronic in that film and explains why his father, Stan Winston, favored a variety of practical and digital techniques to convince audiences the \"Jurassic\" dinosaurs were real.\n\nHowie Weed, a digital effects artist on \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park,\" and Jon Alexander, the compositing supervisor on that film, discuss the techniques used to bring the chicken-sized Compys to life.\n\n\"Jurassic Park III\" (2001) director Joe Johnston explains how his team engineered the climactic battle between the Spinosaurus and T. rex, while Matt sheds light on the process of sculpting and assembling the Spinosaurus puppet for that film, the largest animatronic ever made for a movie.\n\nFinally, Neal Scanlan, the creature effects supervisor on \"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\" (2018), and David Vickery, the VFX supervisor on \"Fallen Kingdom\" and \"Dominion,\" tell us how they brought the franchise's creatures into the modern day with innovative techniques in both the physical and digital worlds. Neal describes how \"Fallen Kingdom\" expanded the role of practical creature effects, including the variety of partial animatronics his team created for the Indoraptor, a new fictional species introduced in the film. And David, coming off \"Jurassic World: Dominion,\" shares the 'digital archaeology' process that his team used to restore the model of the T. rex from earlier films, the Quill software ILM's engineers built in order to give the dinosaurs feathers, and how the VFX team worked with John Nolan's animatronics team to give birth to complex creatures like the Giganotosaurus.\n\n\"Jurassic World: Dominion\" is now playing in theaters.\nhttps://www.jurassicworld.com/ \n\nFor more from ILM:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ilmvfx\nhttps://twitter.com/ILMVFX \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ILMVFX/ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/ilmvfx \n\nFor more from Stan Winston:\nhttps://www.stanwinstonschool.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/stanwinstonschool \nhttps://www.facebook.com/StanWinstonSchool \nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanwinstonschool \n\nFor more from Neal Scanlan:\nhttps://www.nealscanlan.com/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Superhero Costumes Evolved From 'Adventures Of Superman' To 'The Batman' | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkhrw0q5JBo\nHow Disney's Animated Hair Became So Realistic, From 'Tangled' To 'Encanto' | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvTchBdrqdw\nHow Realistic Animatronics Are Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNIfx0Xddzc\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#JurassicPark #MoviesInsider #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "One of the biggest challenges for Hollywood’s stunt performers is creating flight that is both safe and believable. Since George Reeves portrayed Superman in the 1950s, movies and TV shows have used an endless variety of wires, pans, and other rigs to lift actors up high. The best tools depend on the type of flying on-screen. A huge breakthrough came in 1978's “Superman” when a visual effects artist discovered a way to operate the camera so that Christopher Reeve would appear to be flying even when he was lying flat. Today, many of those same wire and camera tricks are still used. However, digital doubles can make even the most dangerous flying tricks possible, while flying moves can be programmed in advance into a robotic arm, as seen in “Black Widow.” Elizabeth Olsen’s stunt double, CC Ice, told us about the many ways both Marvel’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and “WandaVision” made Wanda Maximoff fly.\n\nThanks to everyone who spoke with us and shared footage for this story:\nCC Ice - https://www.instagram.com/cc_ice_stunts/\nRob Inch - https://www.instagram.com/allstunts/\nDayna Grant - https://www.instagram.com/daynastunts/\nChristiaan Bettridge: https://www.instagram.com/stannibombani/\nZac Henry: https://www.instagram.com/zac.henry/\nRobomoco: https://robomoco.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/robomoco/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RobomocoUK\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nHow Superhero Costumes Evolved From 'Adventures Of Superman' To 'The Batman' | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkhrw0q5JBo\nWhy Helicopters Are Used to Film Action Scenes | Movies Insider | Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VInlj2bV9u0&t=65s\nHow 'No Way Home' Pulled Off Spider-Man's Bridge Fight Against Doctor Octopus | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqSYUu2uWJQ\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#filming #moviesinsider #insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

And it was possible in part due to technological advancements in the past 80 years that have transformed superhero costumes in movies and TV shows. Marvel and DC movies like \"Iron Man\" (2008) and \"Man of Steel\" (2013) have consistently utilized the latest technology to make costumes more real than ever. 3D printing, CGI, and motion-capture technology all helped create costumes with greater detail and practicality to craft the realistic superhuman figures we see on-screen.\n\n\"The Batman\" is available to own on digital download from May 23, 2022, and on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD from June 13, 2022.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:40 \"Adventures of Captain Marvel\"\n1:06 \"Superman\"\n1:39 \"RoboCop\"\n2:37 \"Batman\"\n3:29 \"Spider-Man\"\n4:31 \"Batman Begins\"\n5:27 \"Iron Man\"\n6:18 \"Wonder Woman\"\n6:40 \"Avengers: Endgame\"\n7:23 \"The Batman\"\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nWhat 5 Tom Holland Stunts Looked Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACEL0WwgdDU&t=169s\nHow Batman Movies Pulled Off 6 Batmobile & Batwing Stunts | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmhvOKMUnNo\nHow Costumes Are Destroyed For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKi00WlJo1c\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Costumes #MoviesInsider #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "The fight scenes in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" put a fresh spin on classic kung fu movies. We spoke with stunt coordinator Timothy Eulich and fight choreographers Andy and Brian Le about how the movie's most impressive action sequences came together.\n\nTimothy, Andy, and Brian worked with directing duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, aka the Daniels, to plan and execute the film's fight scenes on a tight budget and shooting schedule, shooting almost entirely within the confines of a single warehouse building in Southern California. Here, they talk about the inspirations and references they pulled from in choreographing the action in \"Everything Everywhere,\" from classic Hong Kong movies and Jackie Chan action flicks to break dancing and parkour. \n\nTimothy has worked as a stunt coordinator and performer on TV series like \"Westworld\" and \"Stranger Things\" and films like \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and \"Cobra Kai.\" Previously, he collaborated with the Daniels on their A24-released \"Swiss Army Man,\" starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe.\n\nAndy and Brian are the brothers and self-taught martial artists behind the popular YouTube channel Martial Club. They appear in several scenes of \"Everything Everywhere\" as both actors and stunt doubles, most memorably opposite Michelle Yeoh in the IRS trophy fight. Previously, the siblings worked on Marvel's \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\" with Andy playing the Death Dealer in the film.\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" is out in theaters.

Getting there took a decade of building the animation, simulation, shading, and grooming tools to represent the full range of hair types, colors, and styles.\n\nWe spoke with four members of the \"Encanto\" team to find out how they did it: Character Look Development Supervisor Michelle Lee Robinson, Consultant for Afro Colombian Representation Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo, Associate Technical Supervisor Nadim Sinno, and Character Look Artist Jose \"Weecho\" Velasquez.\n\nThey help trace the evolution of Disney's 3D-animated hair over the past ten years, from Rapunzel's 70-foot long mane in \"Tangled\" and Elsa and Anna's braids in \"Frozen\" to the curly-wavy hair in \"Moana\" and diversity of textures in \"Encanto.\"\n\nFor more, visit:\nhttps://movies.disney.com/encanto\nhttps://www.disneyplus.com/movies/encanto/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nHow 'No Way Home' Pulled Off Spider-Man's Bridge Fight Against Doctor Octopus | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqSYUu2uWJQ\nHow The Sounds In \"Halo\" Are Made | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpZEzP-I2Q\nHow Realistic Animatronics Are Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNIfx0Xddzc\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Animation #MoviesInsider #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" first introduces legendary Marvel villain Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) on a New York City bridge where he faces off against Peter Parker (Tom Holland). Behind the scenes, the cast and crew filmed on a set in Atlanta and the rest of the bridge and skyline were created in part by Digital Domain. The final fight scene was achieved through a close partnership of visual and practical. Because Doc Ock's mechanical arms were completely CG, special effects supervisor Dan Sudick had to make actions like dropping a cement pipe and throwing a car into water barrels look like they had the right amount of force. Then, visual effects supervisor Scott Edelstein and his team had to create entire shots from scratch if the trajectory of a stunt wasn't correct. And while Digital Domain used digital doubles of Spider-Man for some of the more dangerous stunts, Tom Holland still pulled off many of his own moves on set.\n\nFollow Digital Domain:\nhttps://digitaldomain.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/DigitalDomainDD\nhttps://www.instagram.com/digitaldomaindd/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nWhat 5 Tom Holland Stunts Looked Like Behind The Scenes | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACEL0WwgdDU\nWhy The 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' Illusion Battle Took Nine Months To Make | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Md_neKxec\nHow 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse' Was Animated | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEXUG_vN540\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#SpiderMan #MoviesInsider #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

We go behind the scenes of Halo, one of the world's most popular video games, to find out how the game builds everything from its weapon sound effects to its sci-fi environment.\n\nCreating the sound effects for the latest release, Halo Infinite, required creative Foley and field recording techniques to capture and distort real-world sounds that they can then use out of context in the game.\n\nHalo Infinite's lead sound designer Kyle Fraser and senior sound designers Robbie Elias and Jomo Kangethe break down the techniques used in destinations as far-flung as Tasmania, an airport runway, and a vintage farm machinery heritage site.\n\nThey walk us through the sound effects for vehicles, weapons, and destruction in the game, along with the detailed ambiance and environmental sound for the multiplayer maps.\n\nHalo Infinite is available now with Xbox Game Pass.\nhttps://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/halo-infinite\nWatch \"Halo,\" the new TV series, on Paramount+.\nhttps://www.paramountplus.com/shows/halo/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS: \nHow Realistic Animatronics Are Made For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNIfx0Xddzc\nHow Costumes Are Destroyed For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKi00WlJo1c\nHow Bleeding Prosthetics Are Created For Movies And TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Fi8IN0LrY&t=32s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Halo #Sounds #Insider \n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

                "description": "Spectral Motion has been making animatronic puppets and props for movies and TV shows since 2002. Even if they don’t fully end up in the final shot, they can make for great references for both visual effects artists and the actors in front of the camera. Spectral Motion’s head of animatronics, Mark Setrakian, takes the characters sculpted and painted by the company’s artists and gives them the most realistic movements possible. This has included making giant troll hands compress and handle objects for “Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters” (2013), manipulating robotic bits and foam skin to make a wolflike snarl for “Lady in the Water” (2006), and making the Demogorgon’s face petals move on the first season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” (2016). Advancements in technology allowed Spectral Motion to push the kinds of terrifying movements it gave to the animatronic White Spike puppet who would be acting alongside Chris Pratt and Yvonne Strahovski in “The Tomorrow War” (2021).\n\nFollow Spectral Motion:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/spectralmotion/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/spectralmotioncom\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SpectralMotion/\nhttp://www.spectralmotion.com/\n\nFollow Mark Setrakian, Mark Viniello, and Kevin McTurk:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mark_setrakian/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/vin1fx/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thespiritcabinet/\n\nMORE MOVIES INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Tom Holland Pulled Off 5 \"Spiderman\" and \"Uncharted\" Stunts | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACEL0WwgdDU\nHow Batman Movies Pulled Off 6 Batmobile & Batwing Stunts | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmhvOKMUnNo\nHow Costumes Are Destroyed For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKi00WlJo1c\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Animatronics #MoviesInsider #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

The actor does work with stunt doubles, but his gymnast and dancing background gives him an advantage and helps him to perform aspects of his own stunts. This includes pole-vaulting in 2019's \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" swinging through the streets of New York City with Zendaya in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" and climbing up a replica of the Washington Monument in 2017's \"Spider-Man: Homecoming.\" Here’s a look at 5 risky stunts the actor performed himself, including what he called the most difficult stunt of his career.\n\nMORE INSIDER VIDEOS:\nHow Batman Movies Pulled Off 6 Batmobile & Batwing Stunts | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/dmhvOKMUnNo\nHow Stunt Performers Pull Off Dangerous Falls In Movies & TV Shows | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/oe_pLp5iihc\nHow Costumes Are Destroyed For Movies & TV | Movies Insider\nhttps://youtu.be/cKi00WlJo1c\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Stunts #Spiderman #Insider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
