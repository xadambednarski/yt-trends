It has a theater room with 85 in 4K Roku TV to watch the big game, pool table, arcade games, Xbox, whiskey bar. It's an awesome accommodation for a group with 2 kings, 2 queens, and 3 twins. Backyard was the best, it has a saltwater pool, hot tub and best of all USGA putting green that we spent most of our time on. Tucasa is the ultimate desert getaway\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/elevated_stay?igsh=YzVkODRmOTdmMw%3D%3D&utm_source=qr",

There's so much I want to say but words do not do it justice. 12 years of blood, sweat and tears. We did it. I never thought I would make it this far when I started. 100,000 seemed so far out of reach. It took me 2 years to get 1,000 subscribers. This just goes to show, take it one step at a time. Day by day, brick by brick. Follow your dreams and don't give up. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt be here without you. \n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart. \n\nLove you guys, \n\n- Big Daws",

I got a quote from the dealer for a new oem catalytic converter but it was around $3900 which was more expensive than the value of the car. Since her state has emissions every 2 years I got an inexpensive cat that will work in the meantime. So here is how to replace a stolen cat. This repair has gotten her passed emissions, the exhaust doesnt smell, and the car is now usable saving her around $3700. I would say that is a win! \n\n$110 cat: https://amzn.to/3MRFZd3 \n$40 shield: https://amzn.to/47fBnXa",

You will know the axle seals are bad because gear oil will drip down the tires and sling everywhere. Luckily with this video you can see the process of replacing the axle seals. First you need to drain the differential. Next you need to unscrew the 4 nuts holding in the axle. Then you need to use a slide hammer to pop the axle out and now you have access to the seal. Use a seal puller tool to pop the seal out and then drive the new one in with a large socket or a seal driver tool. Now would be a good time to replace the rear wheel bearing as well and to do that you need to cut the bearing in half to remove it and then use a pipe with a hammer (or a hydraulic press) to press the new one on. \n\nDonut Media Collab: https://youtu.be/AuuQdQXnTaw?si=jae15LApv76YTow0\n\nCraftsman Overdrive Socket Set: https://bit.ly/CraftsmanSocketSet\nCraftsman Overdrive wrench set: https://bit.ly/CraftsmanWrenchSet\nTorque Wrench: https://amzn.to/3Q4ndju\nSledge Hammer: https://amzn.to/45NROrE\nSlide Hammer: https://amzn.to/46Q9cNF\nSeal Puller Tool: https://amzn.to/493hW4J\nPlier Set: https://amzn.to/3Sb15a5\n\n0:00 How to tell if the axle seals are bad\n1:47 Tools needed to replace axle seal\n2:37 How to Lift Vehicle\n3:32 How to Drain Differential Gear Oil\n4:43 How to Remove Axle\n6:53 How to Use a Slide Hammer\n7:54 How to Replace Seal\n10:37 How to Replace Drum Brakes\n12:05 Reinstall Everything\n13:59 Axle Seal Replacement Summary\n14:50 How to Fill Differential with Gear Oil\n15:44 Conclusion\n\n‚Üí As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n‚Üí Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7\n‚Üí Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit\n‚Üí Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8\n‚Üí Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com\n‚Üí My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix\n\n**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a \"thumbs up\" and consider subscribing.**\n\nDisclaimer:\nDue to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

You never want to buy new tires older than 18 months and you want to start thinking about replacing your tires if they are 6yrs old and at 10yrs or more definitely replace them!\n\nWhen I got my first set of new tires for my first car I was so excited. On the drive home I spun out on a turn and almost wrecked my car. I didnt take the turn fast or anything and I was so confused at what happend. After doing research I found my \"new tires\" were actually 7 years old and the rubber had become brittle and less grippy. Tire-easy would not let me exchange the tires because they were mounted so I learned an expensive and almost deadly lesson. Always check the tire age before buying tires!",

                "description": "We took Owen on a surprise trip to \"Florida\" for his 6th birthday.  He loves Cici's Pizza (which is nowhere within even HOURS of where we live), so we made our own Cici's and then went to Legoland \"Florida\" (luckily Owen can't read the word \"California\" on the signs there).  Owen really loves Florida and had been planning a trip there for his birthday all on his own, even though I was trying to drop the hint that we couldn't leave town this year.  When even his school teacher was telling me about his elaborate trip to Florida plans, I knew we could make something work and the trip was just what he had hoped for.  One day he will realize that the drive was 3-4 hours, not 3-4 days. (insert big smile of a loving mom here)\nGet a personalized video from us to you!

I've always said I don't like hiking but that's because in the past \"hiking\" was more like walking in dirt instead of walking on the street by the house.  This was different, and I LOVED it!  Of course all the boys were thrilled that we were climbing like we did since they're monkeys.  Anyway, it was a fantastic trip with hikes that we truly can't wait to do again!\nGet a personalized video from us to you!

It is a premier sports school in the nation!  Our 5 oldest went to train in one of their summer programs for soccer.  This will give them a taste of what it would be like to be a full time student at IMG.  They will board there during the program which means eating and sleeping there (yes you can expect vlogs of this on each of their individual channels soon as well!).  We will have another vlog on FFP that will give you guys a more intensive look at what it is like at IMG because we spent some time with them on campus so we could see what it was all about!  If you are into sports, you should DEFINITELY check out IMG Academy.  We highly recommend them.  It truly is the best of the best when it comes to sports! \nCheck out IMG here: https://imgacademy.com/familyfunpack\nPromo code familyfun22 offers $100 off each week of camp booked.

We went to Arizona for a tournament and I'll just say it did NOT go smoothly from start to finish, but David did play great including scoring 3 goals!  The place we stayed.....well that was a whole story in itself.  Then Owen got hurt.  He was just sitting near me on the sidelines when a ball hit him straight in the face.  It came faster than expected because of the crazy winds.  I had both my hands tied up holding Chloe and Matt was on the other end of the field watching David.  Luckily our friend helped with Owen.  Poor thing, the ball hit him so hard it sent him flying!  Anyway, we hope you enjoy the vlog because it was overall a very memorable trip!\nGet a personalized video from us to you!

My name is Vivienne, and I like to animate cartoons and songs!\nI am a grad of SVA in NYC, majoring in traditional animation, and I animate films based on the silly characters I keep coming up with! I have also taken to trying to fan animate some songs every now n' then. Songs that give me inspiration or direct visuals! I adore musicals and villains and animals, can't you tell? Hope you enjoy! c:\n\nFAQ:\n\"What programs do you use?\" TV Paint for animation, Adobe premiere, After effects, Sai and Photoshop!\n\"When is your next animation?\" Animation takes time, but I'm almost always working on something! Soon as I can finish you'll see it!\n\"What are these characters you draw from?\" They are from my various projects, I have TONS of projects!\n\"Why is your taste in music such shit?\" It's cause it's my taste in music, it's not yours. I choose what songs I LOVE so they aren't shit to me!\n\nCURRENT PROJECTS: \n\nHazbin Hotel (comedy/Musical series) -IN Production-"

The couple met at a party where Samantha's small stature caught Michael's eye. She is a little person born with a rare type of dwarfism. Michael is 6ft 2 whilst Samantha is 4ft, they get a lot of attention because of their two-foot height difference. Samantha explained: \"We have so many people trying to take pictures. It's sometimes scary because people will follow me.\" Michael added: \"We get comments all the time like, how did he even get with her?\" Online, they get negative remarks such as \"that man knows he's straight violating\" and rows of laughing face emojis. \"They're trying to make me a fetish,\" Samantha said.

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n YESSENIA has been accused of selling her own child. The 27-year-old mother-of-three decided to become a surrogate after she experienced a miscarriage. Yessenia said: ‚ÄúIt changed my life forever. It ended up leading me to surrogacy so I could help other people have children.‚Äù Yessenia has three children - Tyson, Trey Jr. and Tamir with husband Trey. She said: ‚ÄúI was really nervous about talking to my husband about surrogacy. It was something I really wanted to do, but I know there's a lot of stigma around the subject.‚Äù However, her husband was supportive from day one. Yessenia decided to share her surrogacy journey online to help other women going through or even considering going through the process but was shocked to get extremely judgemental comments as well as congratulatory ones. She said: ‚ÄúI have got a lot of hate online that I never really expected from sharing my journey.‚Äù Trolls online accused her of ‚Äòselling‚Äô her own child, that the child was hers and said she was ‚Äòselling‚Äô herself and her body. She added: ‚ÄúI think a lot of people think surrogacy is a get rich quick scheme. But it's not that at all.‚Äù Yessenia hopes to be a surrogate again in the future and has felt encouraged by how many people she has guided through the process as well as her favourite moment of the process - seeing the baby in the  intended parents‚Äô arms for the first time. Yessenia reflected on her journey and said: ‚ÄúI felt so proud of what I did.‚Äù\n\nSocial Media Links: \nFollow Yessenia on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@mamayessenia \n\n\nCredits: \nVideographer: Jesse Roberts\nSecond Cam: Zane Hall\nSeries Producer: Kim Nguyen\nProducer: Emika Berry\nCasting Producer: Courtney Buabeng\nEditor: Moe Najati \n\n\nIf you have an amazing story and want to appear on the show, please email trulycasting@futurenet.com and the team will be in touch! \n\nClick below to follow your favourite Truly shows on social media!\n\nTikTok:\nTruly - https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\nTransformed - https://www.tiktok.com/@transformedshow\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://www.tiktok.com/@lovedontjudgeshow\n\nSnapchat:\nBorn Different - https://bit.ly/3XluKiQ\nHooked On The Look - https://bit.ly/3Xi0UM6\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://bit.ly/3XkEDNJ\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://bit.ly/3Z05bFe\nDating Different - https://bit.ly/3XkRbEU\nMiami Muscle - https://bit.ly/471TQX8\nRahki‚Äôs World - https://bit.ly/3yL9lX3\nBrand New Me - https://bit.ly/3MtxpRb\nBling Life - https://bit.ly/3Xi0Agv\nTransformed - https://bit.ly/45bDs3R\nShake My Beauty - https://bit.ly/3Z18hZH\n\nFacebook:\nBorn Different - https://www.facebook.com/BornDifferentShow/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.facebook.com/HookedOnTheLook\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://www.facebook.com/myextraordinaryfamilyshow\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://www.facebook.com/lovedontjudgeshow\nShake My Beauty - https://www.facebook.com/ShakeMyBeauty\nTruly - https://www.facebook.com/TrulyShow/\n\nInstagram: \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\n\nWhatsApp:\nTruly - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7rMHN3LdQb9EImSq1k\nBorn Different - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7LtVj5vKAECosskZ3W\nShake My Beauty - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6zwHg3QxRwc7oziV2f\nHooked On The Look - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va73ZzGFsn0jE5Qccg2K\nLove Don't Judge - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6nERS3wtb0ygxXSl3X\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7KtwY4Y9lltHCqba2N\nTransformed - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7EJ2y4inor5ddlOe1z",

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\n20-YEAR-OLD Siri was born with a rare brittle bone disease called hypophosphatasia (HPP) - she just didn't know it until three years ago. Having broken numerous bones and teeth \"with ease\" throughout the course of her life, Siri and her mom Katherine suspected for a long time that there was an underlying condition at play. Siri told Truly how she \"broke three ribs getting out of bed\" and \"shattered a tooth just eating a sandwich\" and with no official diagnosis until she was 17 years old, damage had already been done. A particularly complex break of her elbow when she was just five years old was repaired by doctors at the time - or so Siri thought. Unfortunately, her bones did not heal correctly and she was left with a trapped nerve in her arm - something she recently underwent surgery for, 15 years on from the original injury. As we follow Siri to her physiotherapy appointment, will she be able to push through the pain barrier to regain the full function of her arm? And now that she is able to take her official diagnosis to the haters online in order to set the record straight, will she be able to prove to them once and for all that there is nothing \"fake\" about her condition?\n\nFollow Siri: \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@notonyouriphone\n\nVideographer: Ellie Walton\nSeries Producer: Kim Nguyen\nVideo Producer: Tom Buckman\nCasting Producer: Laura Conder\nEditor: Alex Saunders\n\nIf you have an amazing story and want to appear on the show, please email trulycasting@futurenet.com and the team will be in touch! \n\nClick below to follow your favourite Truly shows on social media!\n\nTikTok:\nTruly - https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\nTransformed - https://www.tiktok.com/@transformedshow\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://www.tiktok.com/@lovedontjudgeshow\n\nSnapchat:\nBorn Different - https://bit.ly/3XluKiQ\nHooked On The Look - https://bit.ly/3Xi0UM6\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://bit.ly/3XkEDNJ\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://bit.ly/3Z05bFe\nDating Different - https://bit.ly/3XkRbEU\nMiami Muscle - https://bit.ly/471TQX8\nRahki‚Äôs World - https://bit.ly/3yL9lX3\nBrand New Me - https://bit.ly/3MtxpRb\nBling Life - https://bit.ly/3Xi0Agv\nTransformed - https://bit.ly/45bDs3R\nShake My Beauty - https://bit.ly/3Z18hZH\n\nFacebook:\nBorn Different - https://www.facebook.com/BornDifferentShow/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.facebook.com/HookedOnTheLook\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://www.facebook.com/myextraordinaryfamilyshow\nLove Don‚Äôt Judge - https://www.facebook.com/lovedontjudgeshow\nShake My Beauty - https://www.facebook.com/ShakeMyBeauty\nTruly - https://www.facebook.com/TrulyShow/\n\nInstagram: \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\n\nWhatsApp:\nTruly - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7rMHN3LdQb9EImSq1k\nBorn Different - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7LtVj5vKAECosskZ3W\nShake My Beauty - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6zwHg3QxRwc7oziV2f\nHooked On The Look - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va73ZzGFsn0jE5Qccg2K\nLove Don't Judge - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6nERS3wtb0ygxXSl3X\nMy Extraordinary Family - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7KtwY4Y9lltHCqba2N\nTransformed - https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va7EJ2y4inor5ddlOe1z",

                "description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj \n\n20-YEAR-OLD Chelsea was the victim of severe bullying all the way through high school - and it was often physical. Chelsea was first attacked by \"two boys who were older than me\" at the age of 14 - they punched her in the face and broke her jaw. A year later, while walking her dog in the park, Chelsea came across a group of teenagers and was confronted by a girl who accused her of \"flirting with [her] boyfriend\". As Chelsea turned to walk away, she felt the girl jump on her and remembers feeling \"her elbow going into the side of my face\". Both incidents resulted in jaw surgery - with doctors fixing screws and wires into Chelsea's jaw to hold it in place. Worse was still to come though, as the attacks had left her jaw weak and vulnerable. Just a couple of years later, when Chelsea went to spend time with her best friend Katie and the two started play-fighting, Katie's knee accidentally caught Chelsea in the side of her face. She immediately headed to hospital to prepare for her seventh surgery on her jaw - but she could never have predicted how \"all Hell would break loose\" post-surgery. Chelsea remembers how she woke up in her hospital bed and \"couldn't feel my legs, it was like nothing was there\" - and soon she was paralysed from her neck down. She was diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) - a life-changing condition that affects how the brain sends messages to the rest of the body. Chelsea underwent months of grueling rehabilitation and gradually regained mobility, but with some lasting symptoms. She continues to experience seizures, fatigue, chronic pain and her left wrist is affected by functional dystonia, leaving her with the use of only her finger and thumb on that hand. And when Chelsea took to TikTok to post about her situation and quickly gained a following, she was once again on the receiving end of negativity, with people accusing her of \"faking it, attention-seeking\". Through it all though, Katie has stuck by Chelsea, who feels that the \"whole experience has made us closer\". However, even after all these years, Katie still feels guilty for her part in Chelsea's life-changing diagnosis - and Truly filmed the pair talking about the accident for the first time on camera. Does Chelsea blame her friend at all for what happened, or will she finally be able to put Katie's mind at ease?\n\nVideographer: Max Thurlow\nProducers:‚ÄÇHannah Beaugeard, Tom Buckman, Georgia Embling\nEditor: Dalene Low\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\n00:00 Intro\n0:35 Meet Chelsea - Learn About Her Bullying Experiences \n1:06 Chelsea Speaks About Bullying Becoming Physical & Her Surgeries \n1:53 Speaking About Her Best friend - Who Caused Chelsea's Paralysis \n2:48 Chelsea Was Diagnosed With FND\n3:42 Meet Chelsea's Best Friend - Katie \n4:17 Chelsea And Katie Speak About The Incident \n6:30 Outro - \"If you are thinking of picking on someone, my story is an example of what can happen!\"",

People often assume that Lyndsey, age 22, is a child and the pair are in an underage relationship. However, Lyndsey‚Äôs tiny size is due to a rare form of cancer she was diagnosed with at the age of five. The cancer caused her hormones to stop working and meant she didn‚Äôt grow taller than 4ft10. The couple have to deal with stares and whispers in public (Jonathan is a whole foot taller at 5ft10) but they receive most of their negative comments from trolls online. Jonathan says ‚Äúit can be hard but because we love one another we just push it to one side‚Äù. \n\nFollow their story here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lyndsey_ashton22/\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@lyndsey_ashton22\n\nVideographer: Nick Stubbs\nProducers:‚ÄÇAlicia Bailey, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Emma Mitchell\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

It hasn't been an easy journey for the couple to conceive and after rounds of failed IVF, the couple had almost given up hope until Mindy finally fell pregnant in December 2021. When they shared the news on social media, the announcement led to a tidal wave of backlash, with people accusing the couple of \"being selfish\" for having a baby because of Larry's age. Despite the criticism, Mindy and Larry say they are excited to welcome their first child and have plans to try for a second one.

MRKH has affected Jaclyn throughout her life, growing up as a young woman she felt different and was confronted with questions about her own womanhood. Despite her condition Jaclyn has always been determined to be a mother with her loving husband Jon. Together the couple have struggled through failed IVF and surrogacy attempts but are now excited to welcome their child thanks to Jon‚Äôs cousin Kelly acting as their surrogate. Jaclyn said: ‚ÄúSomething that I wish people knew about MRKH syndrome is that it doesn‚Äôt make me or anyone diagnosed less of a woman, just because you can‚Äôt give birth to a baby, there are many other ways to mother.\"\n\nVideographer: Marcus Cooper\nProducers:‚ÄÇRafaela Kuznec, Georgia Embling, Kim Nguyen, Alicia Bailey\nEditor: David Bamford\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

But it wasn‚Äôt until her late teens that she realised she was objectum-sexual - a term that means an attraction to things rather than people. She is now in a relationship with a chandelier called Lumiere and says that people don‚Äôt give her a chance to explain her unusual love interest and wants to break down the misconceptions of this type of love. The brave woman has faced countless judgements from people who do not understand her love but believes that no matter what you do, what you love or how you act, there will always be people that won't accept you - so instead she has accepted herself and has never been happier. Amanda said: ‚ÄúI make these films to open people's eyes, not only about objectum-sexuality but to anybody who feels like an outcast or feels different, what matters is your health and your happiness. Generally speaking, I think there's still a lot of misunderstanding in the world. But I think they‚Äôre becoming more open to difference and uniqueness. I think there's more acceptance than there was but there's certainly still work to be done. In general people find it difficult to understand and I can understand that.‚Äù\n\nVideographer: Marcus Hessenberg\nProducers: Dan Coles, Yasmin Walker\nEditor: Giulia Bassanese\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

The family believes in plural marriage but it took some time for Sophie and Tami to adjust to life as sisterwives. Sophie told Truly: ‚ÄúThe hardest part was realising that Tami and I didn‚Äôt know each other very well. We didn‚Äôt understand each other's personalities‚Äù. Initially this created some tension within the family. Colton said: ‚ÄúThere were misunderstandings‚Ä¶sometimes it kind of felt like I was standing in the middle of a tornado‚Äù. Communication has been key to the success of this plural marriage, with Colton making time each month to go on dates with both his wives. The family also prioritises spending time with their kids by going to the local farm.

But when he was 12, Rafi suffered a terrible stroke and haemorrhage that forced him to relearn how to walk and talk. His body was forced into locked-in syndrome. Rafi's family would initially communicate with him just by blinking eyes at one another. But over time, Rafi has re-learnt how to walk and talk - though the stroke, which was caused by an Arteriovenous malformation (AVM), has left him with long term speech issues and also some memory loss. With an incredibly positive attitude, Rafi hasn't let anything stop him and he started modelling as a teenager and also took up competitive racerunning - where competitors use a frame to race. He has no problem attracting women on Tinder but getting beyond a first date has proved more difficult. On his profile he describes himself as a 'para athlete' and uses the emoji of a walking frame to indicate he has a form of disability...

Growing up she always struggled with her weight, and accounts her love of comfort food as being her achilles heel. She had lost a significant amount of weight in her twenties, but after getting married at 24, she slowly started to add the weight back on.  Amanda gave birth to a healthy first daughter with husband John, but after losing a second trimester pregnancy her weight spiralled out of control. It wasn‚Äôt until the birth of her second daughter that she knew she needed to take action. Amanda told Truly: ‚ÄúWhen I had my second daughter and she was healthy, that was definitely the kickstart to me losing weight and becoming a better parent.\" She started with walking and implementing small lifestyle changes, and never looked back. Amanda now works out seven days a week, often with her father, who jokes that she outlifts him now. Despite her lifestyle changes and impressive weight loss, Amanda was left with excess skin that she had removed via an abdominoplasty. Things didn‚Äôt quite go to plan with some complications as a result of the anaesthesia, which left Amanda in hospital for 10 days recovering. Now fully healthy and recovered, Amanda wants to acknowledge the journey she has been on with a celebratory photoshoot as she shows off her new look. \n\nFollow Amanda here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/lifeinleopardpumps/\n\nThank you to Cindy for her photography, to find more of her work follow her here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cindymendezphotography/ \n\nVideographer: Colin Bell\nProducers:‚ÄÇJoel Ross, Natalia Giorgi\nEditor: Reuben Yarwood\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

Throughout her teenage years, Karen, now 28, had clear skin. But then, in her early twenties, she was hit by an outbreak of cystic acne. In May 2021, she also developed rosacea, leaving her in so much pain that she would often wake up to a bloodied pillow, and found that even smiling hurt. Her confidence was so impacted that she would not even let her own family see her without makeup. Then one day, she was scrolling Instagram, when she came across the #acnepositivity community - thousands of people sharing unfiltered photos of their skin in a bid to normalise acne and fight back against stigma. Realising her own story could help others, she took the plunge and shared a barefaced selfie - the first thing she had posted on social media in five years. Now, she continues to share her story in the hope she can inspire others. She concluded: \"Now, I look at my textured skin and I embrace it.

The beaming advocate has had her share of negativity due to her lack of locks but it's only made her stronger and now she shares that strength with thousands of followers every day while going one step further in creating and offering products specifically designed for people who have been, are going through or are starting the same journey she has spent her life battling herself. Chloe said: \"I posted my very first video of me going bald and the whole process of the bald spots, how it got bigger and bigger. And then my dad shaving my head on TikTok and it received a ton of support. I had so many people reaching out to me saying that they're going through the same thing. I was very surprised when it got that much attention. It went global which allowed me to really pinpoint that I want to do this throughout my lifetime.

From an early age, Rochelle, 26, from Phoenix, Arizona, has been interested in all things retro. Some of her happiest childhood memories are of trawling the aisles of antique stores with her mother. And as an adult, her love of the past continued to grow. In 2018, she and her husband Matt bought their first home together. The property had been built in 1957, but remodelled in the 1970s. Rochelle then spent the next 18 months - and $50,000 - restoring it to its original glory. Now, every appliance and piece of furniture in her home is vintage - as is her entire wardrobe. She concluded: \"I would say I'm obsessed with vintage. It might be a little crazy, but it's fun.\"\n\nFollow Rochelle here: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/uniquelyrochelles/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@uniquelyrochelles\n\nVideographer: Andrew Keil\nProducers:‚ÄÇErin Cardiff, Yasmin Walker \nEditor: Ethan Edwards \n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",

I have been doing this crazy viral shampoo pranks for over a year now! If you're new to this prank series it's basically me pranking unsuspecting and random people who are at the beach and are about to take a quick shower ! I wait for them to use their own soap or shampoo and start shampooing their hair , once I notice that their soap or shampoo is almost washing off their hair I jump in and start adding some more of my own super soapy shampoos to their hair. After doing Shampoo Pranks Parts 1 to 10 I pretty much am known as the Venice Beach Shampoo Prank guy! Haha! I've gone to other beaches in California such as Huntington Beach , Malibu , Newport Beach and Corona Del Mar but no beach comes as near as Venice Beach when it comes to hot girls , buff bodybuilders and awesome , unsuspecting strangers ! What pranks should I do next? Would you guys want me to do more gold digger pranks where I go around Los Angeles and expose gold digger girls who at times are even married and are un loyal to their husbands ? Should I do more shampooing people pranks at Venice or Santa Monica beaches ? Should I travel to other beaches such as Miami or other countries even to shampoo different types of people?

I have previously done over 8 Shampoo Pranks for you guys to watch! Each time I do this never ending soap prank I come up with a different edition, or twist! I've done shampooing people prank fake blood edition, boyfriend edition, girlfriend edition, itching powder edition, police office and cop edition, gone wrong editions and cold water editions! You guys love watching these pranks so I'd like to continue doing more! What should I do next as the upcoming shampooing people pranks? More cop editions? How about a hair dye one? Should I do one where I team up with sexy girls and prank people? Should I do more fake blood editions? Should I do a ice bucket challenge shampoo prank? The ideas are endless! Comment yours below! Also I have recently started a new prank series I've called the Gold Digger Pranks where I approach, and expose unfaithful, unloyal gold diggers that first reject me but then try to get with me once they realize I have a Lamborghini or another exotic car. Do you guys like Gold Digger Pranks? What is another prank series you'd like me to start? A few of you have been suggestion Bait Bike, Bait Skateboard, and other Bait pranks where I catch thieves stealing stuff in public and prank them! Comment your thoughts below as I love reading and responding to them!

We've done Shampoo Pranks with fake blood, fake hair, we teamed up with a fake police officer, we used cold water, we've had girl's and guy's edition and so much more and the idea of a stranger's struggle with never ending Shampoo is still funny. This time I had to think of a new, even more creative and crazy way to do the Shampoo Prank so I decided to use itching powder! We got some hilarious reactions and unfortunately even pissed off a boyfriend to the point where he tackled me down. Do you guys want to see more Shampoo Pranks? What should be the next part? More fake hair editions? More fake blood? Another Itching Powder edition?

Shampoo Prank Part 7 is finally here! After weeks of planning I've finally managed to team up with an awesome, badass movie police officer. Even though he is an actor he still looks very much alike a real cop. In this Shampoo Prank I teamed up with officer melloy to prank people taking showers at the beach. And just right when they were going absolutely crazy trying to figure out where all this magic shampoo was coming from I sent in my assistant prankster to have him tell people they've broken the 5 minute shower rule at the beach and will not be receiving a ticket. Of course both the officer and the ticket are fake but we still got some crazy hilarious reactions. A few got very confused, few got upset and nearly caused the whole prank to go wrong but everyone thought it was funny at the end once we revealed to them that they were part of a HoomanTV prank video! Previously I've done shampooing people pranks using fake blood, fake hair, mens version and girls version. Should we do another shampooing people prank next? Should it be another cop edition? More bloody shampoo? More hot, beach babes? Comment your ideas below!

Shampooing people prank part 4 girls version is finally here! During part 3 we only got a chance to use fake blood in the public showers on one person and you guys went crazy and asked us to use more on the next prank. So we did! We headed back to the beach again. This video was going to be a girl's edition so we had to try and catch hot girls in bikinis taking a shower at the beach. It wasn't easy as it's still not summer here in California but after waiting long and boring hours we finally started getting some funny reactions! Part 2 never ending shampoo was also a girl's edition and it was very fun to make as girls would have much different reactions than guys to the never ending shampoo or the fake blood! Of course the views on the girl's version was a lot higher than guy's version clearly because girls have sexy butts and boobs and you guys seem to really enjoy that. Haha! We did go after and find every girl we pranked just so we can let them know that it was a prank and they totally loved the prank idea! Do you guys want to see a Shampooing People Prank part 5 next? Maybe a fake police officer edition? Should we do another guy's version again or would you guys like to see more sexy college babes? :) Let us know in the comments!\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nAbout this channel: My name is Hooman Nouri and I'm the creator of HoomanTV.

Shampoo Prank Part 3 is here! This time we decided to add a little twist and use fake blood also to end the prank. This video took a total of 12 hours to film in public and at the beach and we got some crazy, funny reactions. We did tell everyone we pranked it was a joke and of course asked for their permission to be in the video. Nearly everyone loved the unique, simple yet hilarious prank idea and are probably watching this video on YouTube right now! Shampoo Prank Part 1 and Part 2 got so much support from you guys that we decided to give it a try again. Would you guys like to see more shampooing people pranks in the future? A Part 4? Maybe a girls version bloody shampoo prank with red dye? If yes then like and share this video!

This prank got an insane amount of support from you guys on here and even over Facebook. Many asked for a part 2 and for me to try it on girls this time. So I did! I went to the same beach and waited around in public until girls who had just surfed or swam in the ocean came to take a quick shower to wash off the sand & the ocean water. Surprisingly many people takes showers at the beach and even bring along shampoos which makes it even better because they think the soap is coming off their own shampoo! Filming this video was fun and every person we pranked was told that this was nothing but a silly joke. A few didn't find it too funny and are not in the video. Would you guys like a part 3 shampoo prank? Maybe a red dye shampoo edition to make it look like it's blood? There is another youtube channel called thechaizychannel and they have also done a shampoo prank worth watching you should check out while I work on the part 3!

This was probably one of the simplest yet funniest pranks I have ever filmed. The idea is simple. I went out and bought a ton of shampoos then headed to the beach so I can find a few random strangers taking a shower in public. I then would wait as they washed their head and just about finished before sneaking up right behind them to keep on adding more shampoo. The result was hilarious! It would only get funnier as I would just camp behind then and keep on doing the same thing for a while. People were so confused trying to figure out why the shampoo they are using is not washing off. I really enjoyed filming this prank and people watching thought it was hilarious and easily one of the funniest pranks to pull off so I'm going to consider doing a shampooing people prank part 2! Maybe with more shampoo, a shampooing girls version! If you enjoyed watching this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel!

The video came out hilarious and people loved the prank. On YouTube it got tons of comments, shares and likes so I wanted to try something similar again but maybe a little crazier! The same website that I used to buy the liquid ass from also sold this item called the electric shocking pen or the shock pen which is supposed to be a pretty popular prank gag item. I decided to buy it and film a prank with it! Keep in mind this item may be dangerous to use at certain situations. Kids should not be using this and also individuals wearing a pacemaker should not either. Do not try this at home. This video is not a how-to and I am not promoting the use of this item. It is simply done for entertainment purposes! There is also another very similar item called the shocking gum pack. Would you guys like me to try it for another prank soon? Let me know!

Apparently a clothing company named ODO, or Odorless Denim had been keeping an eye out on my picking up girls in public videos. They decided to hit me up and tell me about these magical, awesome water-resistant or repellent men's jeans they have that are still new to the market. I decided to allow them to send me a pair so I can see if these pants are also any good in helping me get a few phone numbers out in public. I headed to Venice Beach California yet again. I approached college girls hanging out in public by the beach asking them if they would be interested in a quick game. If they win they walk away with a $1000 in cash but if my jeans are truly magical and I win the game they have to take me on a date. The day obviously sounded rigged from the start but it was just an excuse to have fun and nearly every girl was more than down for it. It worked and I got a few phone numbers and met a few beautiful girls. I want you guys to comment your favorite girl in this video and who you think I should call, take on a date and Vlog it on my second channel. Also tell me what kinds of videos you want to see in the future? Should I keep doing how to pick up girls videos? A few are suggesting I should step it up and try kissing pranks and kissing challenges like prankinvasion. Let me know in the comments below!

How about being super rich and driving luxury cars? Do you need materialistic things or is it more just about being funny and confident? I've recently been watching a lot of picking up girls videos on youtube and I realized most of them make it seem so complicated. Some are with guys using a Lamborghini or a Ferrari to successfully pick up a girl without even talking much. But what if you don't have a super expensive luxury car like me? Is there no hope? I don't think of myself as the smoothest pick up dude or even a real pick up artist and it's safe to say I don't have much when it comes to having \"a game\" so I decided to pick up girls. Literally. Watch and see what happens ;). This is now way a how to video and it's more made to be funny and entertain you. I don't suggest or recommend anyone trying this as not every girl will be cool with this. I've noticed a lot of other pranksters like barrybeetv , hotspanish , and prankinvasion doing a lot more kissing pranks and public kissing challenges with random college girls recently. The video pretty much is about them asking girls in public if they want to play a game. If they win they get to kiss the girl. If they lose they get slapped. I'm not yet sure how I feel about these yet but there is a chance I might give this a try for you guys! See you on the next video ;)\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nAbout this channel: My name is Hooman Nouri and I'm the creator of HoomanTV.

It took a few months to convince her to come back since the last time we filmed I pranked her with a chainsaw while wearing a killer clown costume as she was taking a shower. This time we headed to Venice Beach, California to do a smelly feet prank. We dressed Tori as sexy and hot as possible and we had her sit in public and as people would pass by she would ask them to kindly smell her feet because her nail lady might have sprayed too much perfume on her feet. What these guys and girls did not know was the what was sprayed on her feet before was not a perfume..haha!. It was actually this thing called liquid ass which is literally a fart spray. The smell is absolutely disgusting and stinks just like shit. It is impossible to smell it for more than a few seconds without wanting to vomit. This is the first smelly feet liquid ass prank I have ever done. If you would like to see a part 2 or similar videos like and share this one! Maybe a liquid ass smelly armpit prank? Liquid ass stinky clothes prank? Liquid ass smelly fart prank? Or even a awful smelling perfume prank of Tori pouring liquid ass spray in a perfume bottle and asking people if they like the smell of her newly bought perfume or not! Please keep in mind this product ( liquid ass ) is a chemical. If you plan on using it be sure to do it with care and at your own discretion.

Less than 2 weeks now until 2015 Halloween is finally here. The month of scare pranks has been excellent so far and we have already filmed a few terrifying pranks this past few weeks. This time we wanted to go for a more common scary monster. Something you see literally in every other scary movie these days. Yes. Zombies! Scary, hungry zombies! I teamed up with a professional movie makeup artist to put on scary makeup on me. It was a mixture of green and black paint, zombie bite marks, bullet holes, scratches and lots of latex. If you're looking for a cool and easy how to do Halloween makeup video tutorial eel free to watch the behind the scenes time lapse video of the makeup. While filming the prank we actually got some hilarious reactions. People were so scared of the realistic looking makeup and almost no one noticed out hidden camera inside the elevator. Halloween is still not here. Meaning I will be coming back with more horror pranks until then. What do you guys wanna see next? A chainsaw massacre ? Maybe a killer clown prank like the ones by dmpranks ? Or maybe another zombie apocalypse prank ? Next week's prank is already being planned. If I were to give you a hint I'd say it involves the hoverboard and a scary, flying ghost! Subscribe if you're new and give this video a thumbs up! I'll see you next week. \n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nAbout this channel: My name is Hooman Nouri and I'm the creator of HoomanTV.

It's pretty much an electronic, hands free segway. It's got 2 wheels just like the original segway but it's a mini version. Celebrities have been showing off their own on their Instagram and Facebook, you see people post about them on Twitter and Snapchat. Many YouTubers like Yousef from FouseyTube , Roman and his wife from RomanAtWood , Casey from CaseyNeistat , Jesse and Jeana from BF vs GF , and a few other pranksters and vloggers also have used this trending toy in their videos. There are so many freaking brands that all the sudden make these toys. There is the Phunkee Duck , Monster Wheel , Segway , Hover Board , IO Hawk , Air Board , Smart Balance Wheel , UWheel , Erover , and like a million more. Some of them even have a Bluetooth feature on them. Haha! I figured I'd get one and try messing around with it. In this video I attempted to hit on girls using it. I plan on doing a few more pranks and maybe a social experiment with this self balancing scooter so if you enjoyed watching this one be sure to let me know by giving it a thumbs up, writing an awesome comment and sharing this prank with your friends on social media! See you on the next video. \n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nAbout this channel: My name is Hooman Nouri and I'm the creator of HoomanTV.

I want to dress you in all parts of your life, from day to night.\n\nMy heart (and your requests) have led me to designing for you Swimwear, Hiking apparel, Casualwear, and most recently, Underwear! Thank you for trusting me and allowing me to take on new categories! It‚Äôs so fun! \n\nBut...as you can see‚Ä¶I‚Äôve yet to design for the night!\n\nIt‚Äôs been a dream of mine to one day design Sleepwear, and over the past year and a half, that‚Äôs what I have been doing behind the scenes: sketching, using @Adobe Illustrator to make CADs (FYI my fellow designers Adobe just released their new Enhanced Image Trace tool to make vectors in seconds), putting together tech packs, going through what feels like infinite rounds of prototypes and STILL not getting it right. It‚Äôs been a lot tougher than I thought it would be. Shouldn‚Äôt something so loose and comfy be easier? You would think. But because I always challenge myself to design something different from what‚Äôs already out there, and I‚Äôm always pushing for perfection, I end up taking longer than I want.\n\nI mean, I am almost done with the Sleepwear Collection but there are some styles that are holding everything else back. Ugh. Should I just release what I have ready?\n\n‚ù§Ô∏èCassey\n\n#adobeillustrator #adobepartner",

The ‚ÄúTrain like a beast look like a beauty‚Äù design gets so popular that the exact graphic gets ripped off by a large dept store which directly impacts my small biz. I stop making tanks altogether.\n\n2016: I decide to go after my childhood dream of becoming a fashion designer and launch @popflexactive. Everyone‚Äôs excited and it starts off pretty well at first!\n\n2017: I drop my third collection ‚ÄúDark Bloom‚Äù and it FLOPS. The fit is terrible and customers lose trust. The orders nearly come to a halt.\n\n2018: The worst year of my life. Between the internet tearing me down for how I looked, intense toxicity on my own tiny team, and the biz falling apart, I nearly give up. Not just Popflex but Blogilates the channel too. I am barely hanging on but Sam tells me to try one last time. ‚ÄúGive it 30 more days‚Äù he says.\n\n2019 (not pictured): I refocus my energy on who I want to be, instead of being who others tell me to be. I rediscover myself, I rebuild my confidence, and as a result, completely transform my business too.\n\n2021: I have an emotional breakdown. I realize that after 13 years of posting fitness videos and getting body shamed every single day, I had to take a break for my own mental health. During my break, I start showing a side of myself that no one‚Äôs ever seen before. Fashion designer Cassey emerges and my content shifts from teaching home workouts to sharing the creative process behind how I design my products.\n\n2024: From @TaylorSwift wearing the Pirouette Skort to hitting ‚ú®10 MILLION‚ú® subscribers on @YouTube in the same year (WHAT!?), I am SO LUCKY to be living this life and doing what I love Every. Single. Day.\n\n‚ô•Ô∏èCassey",

For my IBTC girlies who have never had cleavage before, wait til you see yourself in the mirror! ü™û I could almost cry.\n\nBonus tip for other A cuppers, size down for a lower neckline and a more intense lift! Do not do this though if you‚Äôre above an A cup! I‚Äôm normally a small but I am wearing the XS A-C cup for my bridgerton effect!\n\nFor girlies with the ‚Äúlarge tatas‚Äù - this style goes up to G! Be warned that this is a balconette though, not a full cup. If you don‚Äôt like the aesthetic of a low neckline (demi cup) and a full cup is what you‚Äôre looking for let me know.\n\nI am currently wearing the green one as I edit and upload this video for you poolside! I love summer so much.\n\nThe boardwalk bombshell bikini top is avail in 4 colors on @popflexactive  rn and comes in xxs to 3x in cups A-G. I hope this works for you!",

                "description": "Dupe culture = counterfeit culture. There, I said it. No one wants to hear it but it‚Äôs true, and it‚Äôs getting absolutely out of control.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing with you what is happening to me right now because I am terrified of the future of dupe culture, especially with its popularity being propelled by the use of AI.\n\nMy Pirouette Skort was first stolen by SHEIN, twice, and then duped numerous times all over Amazon. I eventually was awarded a design patent for my skort in hopes of having some protection. Well, it‚Äôs only gotten astronomically worse after Taylor Swift wore it on TTPD release day. (Grateful forever, however, the extra exposure opened the floodgates for the counterfeiters.) There are dupers coming out from every corner of the internet and I am getting so exhausted trying to whack-a-mole each one. It‚Äôs a lawless place out there in the world of fashion and no one‚Äôs paying attention except for me and my small team, who are often notified by you guys in the DMs. Thank you for watching out for me as this becomes a bigger and bigger problem. \n\nI‚Äôm making this video because I‚Äôm sick of it - all of it. There are too many people being taken advantage of in order for dupe culture to thrive, and guess what? The fact that it grows bigger everyday means more people are being hurt in the process, everyday. From designs being stolen to photography being stolen to content being stolen to Amazon dupe influencers promoting the fake not the original to make a little commission‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an evergrowing snowball of deception.\n\nAnd now with AI messing with people‚Äôs faces and bodies to create even more confusion for the customer‚Ä¶I just feel so hopeless. \n\nIf you are wondering how you can help, I would say USE THE REPORT BUTTON if you see a dupe. These are counterfeits so you can mark as fraudulent. Your use of the report button is just as strong as mine. Any power we may be able to have is through strength in numbers. So please, if you see something weird, report it, and tell others in our community to report it too.\n\nThank you for watching this‚Ä¶I hope this video makes some sort of an impact to take down dupe culture while influencing people to shop more consciously. \n\nüñ§Cassey\n\n#ai #fashiondesigner #dupes #entrepreneur #amazon #amazonfinds #fastfashion #shein",

This may not be a relatable problem for some of you, but for those of you who get it‚Ä¶I get it too, and I feel you.

I‚Äôm always trying to design different things for different needs.\n\nAnyway‚Ä¶\n\nWhen I first released this top, you guys told me you loved it but that I needed to make it reversible‚Ä¶so I did. Brilliant idea guys. This new @popflexactive ‚ú®Reversible Deep V Tee‚ú® is a direct result of your genius.\n\nI also changed the fabric to be super lightweight and flowy so that you can even wear it going out.

It evokes a feeling of femininity and kindness.\n\nüíú PURPLE can inspire creativity and spark new ideas. It‚Äôs also historically a color that was reserved for the royals so it can be linked back to power.\n\nü™ª LAVENDER can encourage calmness and tranquility of the mind as it‚Äôs associated with healing, relaxation, cleanliness and purity.\n\nThank you for suggesting the color of my latest @popflexactiveüîÆDigital LavenderüîÆ color drop!

As you know, it takes time and I am grateful for your patience as we traverse this sports bra journey together!\n\nThe Superbra is avail now in XXS-3X in 5 colors! If you have any fit questions ask me below!\n\n‚ô•Ô∏èCassey\n\nPS: For those of you who didn‚Äôt see my original Ambition Bra vid featuring my water balloon büåºüåºbs, the H cup weight and measurement is explained in that video! However, this bra was tested on hundreds of REAL and different sized büåºüåºbs so rest assured that the support is real büåºüåºb approved üëç\n\n#productdesign #shopwithyoutube #activewear",

                "description": "Tap ‚ÄúView Products‚Äù in the bottom left corner to shop the Low Rise Supershort‚Ñ¢\n\nCalling all millennials who were traumatized by the low rise trend of the 00s! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I honestly have never been able to go low-low as I have a very soft lower belly and hips, so my body type isn‚Äôt highlighted in a way I like with traditional low rise bottoms.\n\n20 years later (omg whattttt), low rise is back, but this time around, I get to control how it looks. Don‚Äôt be scared guys. I found a way for us to do this (if you want to of course) and do it better than in the 00s!\n\nI am very pleased with how my low rise supershort turned out and it‚Äôs my shorts of choice at the moment! I love how it fits right over my hips, it doesn‚Äôt pinch, and it lightly shows off my belly button. Very flattering. On short torso‚Äôd girls, this will probably be like a mid rise on you! \n\nAn honest note on sizing: Initially I had planned to make this in our full size range xxs-3x but all of the plus size fit models we worked with kept it real and said they‚Äôd never wear this. In order to not create extra waste by making something no one wants, we opted not to produce plus sizes, however, if you feel like you actually would wear this - comment and tell me and I can make it for next time.\n\nIm 5‚Äô5‚Äù wearing the small! The waist is very generous in its construction (which is what makes it anti pinch). If you have a softer lower belly like me, stick with your normal size chart size. If you have more muscle in your hips and abs, I would say size down!\n\nHope you like the new options! Oh and for those wondering about thigh chafing - I‚Äôm working on something for you. Thank you for being patient as we develop!\n\n‚ô•Ô∏èCassey\n‚Äã‚Å†@popflexactive\n\n#y2kfashion #fashiondesigner #shopwithyoutube",

Directed by William Shakespeare, the film stars Jordan Peterson as Quandalius Dinglebottom, a determined Discordian on a quest to find the last remaining female in the Genshin Impact Discord server. As one can imagine, this is nearly an impossible task.\n\nAs Quandalius delves deeper into the land of Discord, he faces a series of challenges that test his resolve and question the nature of reality and what it means to be a woman. The film explores themes of identity, isolation, and the pursuit of a genuine female interaction amidst a sea of men.\n\nWith gripping storytelling and cutting-edge visuals, \"Discord: The Last Female\" is a timely reflection on modern communication and the lengths one will go to find authenticity in a virtual world.\n\nThe creative team includes cinematographer Napoleon Bonaparte, a dynamic score by Henry VIII and Leonardo da Vinci, and production design by Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.\n\nSUBSCRIBE OR I PUNCH YOU\n‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ïó\n‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïö‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïê‚ï£ \n‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ïù‚ïë‚ïë‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïê‚ï£\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïù‚ïö‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïù\n\nfollow all of these for good luck\n‚Ä¢ Twitter - https://twitter.com/bradenboyko\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://instagram.com/beluga1000\n‚Ä¢ Discord - https://discord.gg/beluga",

                "description": "Do british people actually exist? I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single thing about them. And I mean it.\n\nLet's go through the evidence: Where are they from? Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea.\n\nThere is a consensus on British people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these British people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy.\n\nWhat language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed \"\"British\"\" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker. So I looked up \"british dictionary on google\" and what I found was shocking: every word in there was AMERICAN. I kid you not. What this could mean is beyond my capabilities, but I can safely assure you that british people do not exist.\n\n‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ïó\n‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïö‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïê‚ï£ \n‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ïù‚ïë‚ïë‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïê‚ï£\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïù‚ïö‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïù\n\nanyways.... follow these or i will bite you\n‚Ä¢ Twitter - https://twitter.com/beluga1000\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://instagram.com/beluga1000\n‚Ä¢ Discord - https://discord.gg/beluga",

                "description": "A meme (/miÀêm/ MEEM) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of comedic imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. In popular language, a meme may refer to an Internet meme, typically an image, that is remixed, copied, and circulated in a shared cultural experience online.\n\n‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ï¶‚ïê‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ïó‚ïî‚ïê‚ïó\n‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïö‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïî‚ï£‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïê‚ï£ \n‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ïù‚ïë‚ïë‚ï†‚ïó‚ïë‚ïö‚ï£‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïë‚ïê‚ï£\n‚ïö‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïù‚ïö‚ï©‚ïê‚ï©‚ïê‚ïù\n\nfollow these or i will bite you\n‚Ä¢ Twitter - https://twitter.com/beluga1000\n‚Ä¢ Instagram - https://instagram.com/beluga1000\n‚Ä¢ Discord - https://discord.gg/beluga",

The inventive yet overlooked son of Chief Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler, reprising his voice role from the animated franchise), Hiccup defies centuries of tradition when he befriends Toothless, a feared Night Fury dragon. Their unlikely bond reveals the true nature of dragons, challenging the very foundations of Viking society. \nWith the fierce and ambitious Astrid (BAFTA nominee Nico Parker; Dumbo, The Last of Us) and the village‚Äôs quirky blacksmith Gobber (Nick Frost; Snow White and the Huntsman, Shaun of the Dead) by his side, Hiccup confronts a world torn by fear and misunderstanding. \nAs an ancient threat emerges, endangering both Vikings and dragons, Hiccup‚Äôs friendship with Toothless becomes the key to forging a new future. Together, they must navigate the delicate path toward peace, soaring beyond the boundaries of their worlds and redefining what it means to be a hero and a leader. \n\nThe film also stars Julian Dennison (Deadpool 2), Gabriel Howell (Bodies), Bronwyn James (Wicked), Harry Trevaldwyn (Smothered), Ruth Codd (The Midnight Club), BAFTA nominee Peter Serafinowicz (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Murray McArthur (Game of Thrones).\nHow to Train Your Dragon is written, produced and directed by DeBlois. It is also produced by three-time Oscar¬Æ nominee Marc Platt (Wicked, La La Land) and Emmy winner Adam Siegel (Drive, 2 Guns). How To Train Your Dragon is part of the Filmed For IMAX¬Æ Program, which offers filmmakers IMAX¬Æ technology to help them deliver the most immersive movie experience to audiences around the world. \n\nInspired by Cressida Cowell‚Äôs New York Times bestselling book series, DreamWorks Animation‚Äôs How to Train Your Dragon franchise has captivated global audiences, earning four Academy Award¬Æ nominations and grossing more than $1.6 billion at the global box-office. Now, through cutting-edge visual effects, DeBlois transforms his beloved animated saga into a breathtaking live-action spectacle, bringing the epic adventures of Hiccup and Toothless to life with jaw-dropping realism as they discover the true meaning of friendship, courage and destiny. \n\nJoin the fun on Peacock Kids where you can find an endless supply of laugh-out-loud jokes, lovable characters, life hacks, music, magic, gaming and more!",

And a little while ago, I started noticing a LOT of QVC-esque shopping livestreams on my TikTok for you page‚Ä¶. Wigs, crystal scoops, and athleisure galore!! So I decided to investigate to see what it was actually like to participate in these shopping livestreams, if the products they were selling are any good, and also maybe try and figure out why there are so many damn shopping livestreams seemingly everywhere nowadays.

So while we were in Los Angeles a few weeks ago, we got 7 head-to-toe historical makeovers (with hair, makeup, and outfits, oh my) and went on 7 historically accurate dates!\n\nWhich decade was your favorite?

Thanks again to Opera for sponsoring this video üï∫üèª\n\nA couple of quick notes!!\n \nWe do think that our results with the ULV light sprayer with only water could have been coincidental - as it ~was~ a pretty small sample size. Probably the answer there is that it definitely works... if you put disinfectant in it!\n\nMost of these products (or at least some version of them) are also sold on Amazon and AliExpress - however, we wanted to purchase the products from the websites linked to from the tiktok accounts just to \"take them at face value\" and try out the products that they were selling specifically!\n\nAlso, I said \"RIP Tyler\" because he is a sixers fan and they lost this year - other than that, Tyler is fine!!\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! So... has anyone else stumbled upon this side of tiktok... you know the one... the semi-surreal, thousands-of-tiny-packages, smart-home-gadget, ASMR-cleaning-tok? And no I'm not just trying to optimize this description with keywords - that's actually how I would describe it. Well, I've been over there for a couple of *years*, in the land of blue light sprayers, weird bluetooth speakers thrown into buckets of water with live crabs, and shoe dryers everywhere. So I finally gave in and tracked down 4 different smart home gadgets from various somewhat-suspicious looking websites. \n\nSo we tested out the smart window roomba, the ULV blue light sprayer, the fruit and vegetable cleaner, and the collapsible mini washing machine - and tried to figure out, to the best of our ability, what the heck is going on here. What did you guys think of these viral TikTok cleaning products?

So, I've fallen over to the \"overnight sleeper train\" side of youtube - and I am HOOKED, people. And after watching hours and hours of train content, I decided - it was time to try my own hand at it. So we took the California Zephyr train, which travels from San Francisco to Chicago (and also the other direction as well) - across 7 states and over 2,400 miles!! We experienced everything from delays to endless sauce packets to MANY rock sightings. Would you try traveling across the US by train? And where do you think we should we go next?

So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who?

Buckle up & get your fingernails ready, cause this one is a wild ride! a few years ago, I had the crazy idea to make a custom food truck of some sort - I just needed the perfect opportunity to do it. So when Cristine and I decided to create a Holo Taco collection together, I thought why not now - let's make a (holo) taco truck!! \n\nSo we took a super old FedEx truck and renovated it into a batty, vampy, ~holographic~ nail polish truck! Once it was finished, we loaded an army of nail polish into the truck and drove it around to several different meet ups around Raleigh. At each location, we gave away some free nail polish, saw lots of great nail art (a decent amount of which is featured in this video), & gave out some other fiendish goodies for you guys to enjoy (think chocolate & boba)!! \n\nThank you to everyone who could make the event!! What do you guys think of our nail polish truck? What should we turn the truck into next??\n\nAnd now, we‚Äôve finally reached the release date of the safiya x Holo Taco collection!!

Today I let the intrusive thoughts win and melted together every bar of soap sold at Whole Foods‚Ä¶yes, that‚Äôs right - not even Whole Foods is safe from some ~mad franken-science~.\n\nSo we bought 109 bars from 23 different brands - and shredded them all down to tiny little cheese shreds, and then used a \"rebatching\" technique to create one singular & striped franken-bar. The process was long and grueling, but it was definitely worth it in the end since our final franken-bars ended up so cute!! What do you guys think of our final product? And since we've tackled both Lush and Whole Foods soaps now, whose soaps do you want to see us demolish next??? \n\nBig thank you to both Katie at Royalty Soaps & Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry for their expert opinions on our franken-soap!!

So far on our trip, we have taken a communal hot bath at the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, nearly cryogenically frozen ourselves at the ICEHOTEL in Sweden, and now we're on to Arctic Finland to stay in a glass igloo under the northern lights!\n\nFor years, I've been seeing the glass igloos in Finland on my instagram, tiktok - **and YouTube shorts** feeds - and I've always wanted to try them out. I've never seen the northern lights before, and I've also never stayed in a human-sized terrarium before, but I've always been intrigued by those see-through bubble tents - so we decided to go and try one out and see if we freeze our butts off! And while at Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, home of the glass igloos, we also tried a bunch of arctic activities - like snowmobiling, reindeer sleigh rides, dog sledding, and traditional Finnish sauna-ing and ice bathing!! \n\nWhat do you think??

Our room, the Mush-Room, might have been our favorite we saw overall, so we were lucky to get to spend the night there. \n\nThere was a lot to do at the resort (make sure to check out our full Swedish Ice Hotel video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfQOsKmyCNY üßä‚òÉÔ∏è), but we decided to devote a short just to a tour of our frozen crib so you could see it in all of its cottage core glory üêåüçÑ\n\n#travel #tour #hotel #sweden",

                "description": "HELLO FRIENDS!! It's time for my annual bath - and for such an occasion, we decided to travel to most famous geothermal spa in Iceland - the Blue Lagoon. I've been wanting to unleash an international spa travel series for a long time - so here is my formal declaration: it's spa time, baby! \n\nSo this past January, as the first installment of a 3-part Nordic/Scandinavian travel trip, we journeyed to the beautiful, mineral-rich light blue waters of the Blue Lagoon - to soak, smoothie, and face mask, oh my. Will this magical lagoon keep my skin plump and youthful forever? Or will the lava rock exfoliate my face right off? Who knows! \n\nQuick note - we mentioned that the Reykjanes lava field was 800 years old - I think it's actually much, much older than that - but the earliest recorded eruption was about 800 years ago (which is where our fact came from)!\n\nAlso, because I've seen a few comments about it - no, the cups at the lagoon bar are not glass! They are plastic.\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nTyler's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc6BTuuTzfMLKj_RgwuDnQw\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDave Szamet\nMelissa Douglas\nPhil Kinney\nBree von Bradsky\nElizabeth Pinotti\nIshara Mathews\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n1:58 Flying to Iceland\n3:27 A Jet-lagged Day in Reykjav√≠k\n5:46 The Blue Lagoon Retreat Hotel\n7:46 Prepping for the Blue Lagoon\n9:30 Dipping into the Blue Lagoon\n10:51 What is The Blue Lagoon, anyway?\n13:25 The Waterfall\n14:46 The Smoothie Bar\n16:12 The Face Mask Bar\n18:44 Underwater Massages\n19:58 Other Crevices of the Blue Lagoon\n20:39 Steam Room and Dry Sauna\n21:35 The Silica Hotel\n22:26 The Silica Lagoon\n25:52 Outro\n\n#travel #spa #iceland #vlog",

Today it‚Äôs all about color - and as someone who is known for wearing almost only black, I decided to dip my toes into the personal color analysis trend I've been hearing about for years and seeing all over TikTok. Because I've always been curious... am I a winter? Autumn? Summer? Or even Spring? Pastels have never been my forte, but I was open to at least *hearing* about them. So, we took a little detour to Toronto and visited Julia Dobkine from Agile Styling, an expert in color analysis who I‚Äôd been following on Tiktok, to find out my colors, my season, my tones, and everything underneath those tones. What do you guys think? Would you try this?\n\nAlso, thanks to the virtual color analysts, the color key, for their help in fact-checking the video and collaborating on celebrities for the 12 seasons for our graphics! To learn your season virtually, check out @‚Äåthecolorkey_ on Instagram! **celebrities shown here are examples based on the color key's best classification done in good faith but without participation in the color key analysis process.

After many weeks... here is the video that almost defeated me, the grand finale of our Vegas trip - where we ate at every celebrity chef restaurant on the Vegas strip! Now as some of you all may know, Tyler and I are big Food Network fans - and while we were in Vegas, we decided to visit one of every celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip! We stuffed our faces with numerous dishes, from the trash can-iest nachos at Guy Fieri's, to the elegant Italian pasta of Giada de Laurentiis, to the famed Beef Wellington at Gordon Ramsay's. Which restaurant would you try? Should we do a part 2 and go to the Jonas Brothers' restaurant?\n\nAlso, there is some controversy around foie gras that we weren't aware of before filming, our apologies.

So, after a lot of watching from the sidelines, I decided that I needed to try this out for myself - how hard could it actually be? So I ventured to Lofty Pursuits candy store in Tallahassee, FL where Greg & the team taught me how to sling candy - old school style. We made custom flavored drop candy in a press, and two different batches of image candy - one watermelon, and one tiny disgruntled alien.

Or why you can't leave Sephora without a hand full of lipstick swatches? Or why you just love hanging out at Target? I was curious... so I decided to do some research on how different retail stores manipulate you into spending more time at their stores, interacting with their products more, and therefore, spending more of you hard earned cash at their shops. We explored different tactics that Ikea, Target, Sephora, and Ulta use to lure customers in & keep them there until they make a purchase! This is the first of a 3-part series we're gonna be working on throughout the year!\n\nA big thank you to Jen Clinehens for helping us out with this video; make sure to check out her YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowLiketheGreatest\n\nMake sure to check out The Food Theorists' video on Grocery store manipulation here!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqviBPG2uPE\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nWRITTEN by\nRachel Faulkner\nSafiya Nygaard\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nDayana Espinoza\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\nOther sources:\nRemus, Emily. ‚ÄúDisruptive Shopping: Women, Space, and Capitalism.‚Äù The American Historian, The Organization of American Historians\nSegran, Elizabeth. ‚ÄúDepartment Stores Were the Original Retail Startups.

                "description": "Hello friends & welcome to another video!! This week, I traveled to a Lost Luggage store with HopeScope to buy and try some lost luggage items...\n\nOver the past few years, we have tried a number of interesting ~secondhand purchasing experiences~, like buying an abandoned storage unit, buying a box of Amazon customer returns, and visiting an Amazon returns store - and something that I have been very interested in trying for quite a while now, is buying lost airline luggage. Because apparently if you lose a piece of luggage while traveling, and never come back for it, the airline will eventually sell it. And if you're in the US, chances are that they will sell it to the Unclaimed Baggage store in Scottsboro, AL - who sorts through and resells the items from that lost luggage. So we flew down there with our friend HopeScope to check out the store and buy a lost luggage haul of our own: a head-to-toe outfit each!! What did you guys think of our lost looks? Would you shop at this store?\n\nPS - Unclaimed Baggage does sell some of their inventory online here!\nhttps://www.unclaimedbaggage.com/\n\nCheck out HopeScope's channel & video here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAM2fyCjEdROyELretVTiiw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5aHcu19wio\n\nCheck out Unclaimed Baggage here! \nhttps://www.instagram.com/unclaimedbag/\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nLona Smith\nBryce Jennings\nDave Szamet\nNez Covington\nJarvis Rooker\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

As some of you may know, I do like to delve into different algorithmic rabbit holes on good ole' YouTube, and recently, YouTube has been showing me a lot of ASMR Head Spa videos, where ASMRtists get their scalps professionally cleaned to unclog their hair follicles and promote healthy hair & regrowth. And so, I decided to venture to the Blow Me Away Salon in LA to get a Japanese Head Spa treatment, and finally give my head the spa day it deserves. What do you guys think? Would you try something like this?\n\nApologies if my scalp is too disturbing, lol. \n\nAlso - just a heads up, there *are* other contributing factors to dandruff besides just dirty scalp - I think in my case, I just have a lot of buildup, and Arisa zeroed in on that in relation to my particular head. Also also - in terms of maintaining your scalp care at home, Arisa just mentioned using specific scalp cleansing products & serums about once a week! \n\nAlso also - I noticed that some of you guys are skeptical about some of the ingredients of the products & the treatment as a whole - totally fair for you guys to have criticisms about it, I wasn't trying to vouch for every individual ingredient, or for how effective this would be for everybody - I personally enjoyed it, and I just thought it would be interesting to know what they say are the active ingredients. I'll be sure to keep your thoughts in mind for next time we make a video in this arena.\n\nCheck out ASMR Twix's channel (& many head spa videos) here!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC82mWqRZlB45ESh-rIPfJOQ\n\nCheck out Blow Me Away LA here! https://www.instagram.com/blowmeawaysalon/\nhttps://www.blowmeawayla.com/\n\nCheck out Arisa here!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/hair_by_arisa/\n\nOther Blow Me Away head spa videos:\nPopsugar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKvF_FS_tpI\nInsider: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDkxa7ubziw\nBuzzFeed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmhMEDVbnnU\n\nThis video is NOT sponsored!!\n\nCheck out our merch shop here!! https://fiendishbehavior.com\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nMy TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?\nOur livestreaming channel: https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler\nOur YouTube Shorts channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nKelly Yu\nDayana Espinoza\nCarly Dawson\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza\n\n#spa #exfoliation #microscope\n\nChapters (for people who hate microscopes):\n00:00 - Intro\n01:54 - What is a professional scalp cleaning?\n04:34 - Microscope Part 1\n07:03 - The Treatment\n15:58 - Microscope Part 2\n16:48 - My Final Result\n18:42 - Tyler Mini-Vlog",

                "description": "Hello friends! Unfortunately, we come bearing some sad news - our ancient ex-street-cat Crusty passed away a little while ago at the ripe old age of 21.  So we decided to make a little memorial video for him here, as a celebration of his long, dusty life and how much he impacted ours. We met him back in 2015 on the streets, he was there when we started our channel - he judged my ugly clothing and lounged in a giant beanbag - and when we moved across the country, he came too. Tyler & I loved him like crazy, and we're gonna miss him like crazy - and we know that a lot of you guys will too.\n\nA huge thanks to Shelby & Sandy for the really sick art piece - you can check them out here! \nhttps://www.instagram.com/shelbyandsandy/\n\nMUSIC\nVia AudioNetwork\n\nPRODUCED & EDITED by\nSafiya Nygaard\nTyler Williams\nHannah Bruce\n\nGFX by Dayana Espinoza",

As something of a melting fiend, YouTube has recommended me a few different videos about metal casting over the past few months -- and I found myself with a big NEED for FLAME. So, we picked up a bunch of jewelry from the thrift store, and then melted it down into molten metal, cast it into organic shapes with water & frozen peas, and then fashioned our castings into wearable jewelry pieces.

You can check out the show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI64cM3sogg\n\nHere is a bit of a different kind of video, the start of a new series (I hope) - where we trained as boba-ristas and then ran a boba shop for a day! We collaborated with Kung Fu Tea in Charlottesville, VA to learn how their shop operates behind the scenes, then designed a custom drink menu, and made and served people some of our curated boba selections! I‚Äôve been a boba fan for many years, but this was my first time taking a stab at making bubble tea on my own ‚Äî and though I‚Äôm not sure I have a future in the bubble tea-making profession, it was a lot of fun! What did you guys think of our drinks??\n\nAlso, this video was filmed in early October, before the spread of Omicron & I believe UVA has a vaccine requirement for their students. We made sure to comply with all mask requirements and there was a *lot* of hand washing throughout the day!

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the sponsored posts that appear on your TikTok \"For You Page\"! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - so when I finally relented and downloaded TikTok a few months ago -- I figured, we probably had to do a TikTok ad haul as well. So I spent a day scrolling on TikTok until I found 5 different targeted ads, purchased what they were advertising, and then put them to the test to try and figure out why TikTok might think I would like them, and whether or not they were any good. Which item was your favorite??

Thanks to all who entered!\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! Here is a weird video we made where I melted every soap from Lush together into a few different batches of franken-soap!! This type of franken-experiment has worked well in the past across a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, candles, and bath bombs (also from Lush!) - and as some of you may know, over the years I have developed a bit of a soap fixation, having recreated a couple different soap art tutorials, as well as several bizarre soap art hacks from the internet. So I was excited to combine these two interests together by mixing every single soap from a single store to see what kind of soap bar we could whip up. What did you think of our final product??\n\nThanks to Anne-Marie at Bramble Berry and Katie at Royalty Soaps!

A few years ago, we bought an Amazon Return Box from a liquidation website -- and it was kind of crazy, but we *were* able to get a lot of stuff for a pretty big discount. So when I heard about an Amazon Returns Store... I figured we had to go! I got a drone, a spice blender, a go pro lens, a massage chair, and a microdermabrasion tool (and a lava lamp & succulent growth light) -- all for $10 each!\n\nYou can check out Treasure Hunt Liquidators here!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/treasurehuntliquidators/?hl=en\nhttps://treasure-hunt-liquidators.shoplightspeed.com/\n\nQuick note -- the in-store shopping segments were filmed in late July/early August, when the mask mandate in NC was lifted -- which is why you see a mix of mask & no-mask!

                "description": "Hi guys! Imagine this: Sam gets carried away while pretending to be Godzilla and ruining Elsa's house. Now, the poor thing has no place to live beside her ice-cold castle, which is so far away from her friends, Sam and Sue. That doesn't sound too good, right? Luckily, Sam's devoted partner in crafts always has his back. So, today, we're going to build a brand-new miniature house for our beloved Frozen Queen. üë∏üèº‚ùÑÔ∏èüè†\r\n\r\nAs always, we'll start with the base. We've got some ready-made wooden parts that will be just perfect to build a rather big dwelling. Then, we'll work on the walls and floor with wintery textures to make this new house match Elsa's style. Finally, we'll deal with furnishing. Long story short, we'll end up with a beautiful three-story house with a nice balcony and even a pool. You simply have to check it out, friends!\r\n\r\nGive this video a like and subscribe to our channel for more amazing craft videos filled with fun and laughter.

Come on, grab some lemonade, hit play, and enjoy!\r\n\r\nWe will start by covering all our plain nesting dolls with primer to improve the paint set in the future. Then, we'll outline our characters with a pencil. Finally, we'll get to our favorite part‚Äîcoloring!\r\n\r\nThe biggest nesting doll turned out to be a little shy, so we thought, why don't we turn her into Embarrassment üíú The second biggest doll will make a great Joy üíõ It's followed by Sadness üíô and Disgust üíö and so on. All in all, we're gonna decorate the whole nine nesting dolls! Oh, what a nice set it must be!\r\n\r\nAre you already intrigued to see the final result?

And it looks like it's going to be a very interesting one. Just look at how many plastic cups Susie prepared for today! She decided to learn how to get new colors by mixing just a few basic colors. üé® Sounds like a useful piece of information to find out, doesn't it? Then get ready, 'cause we're diving right in!\r\n\r\nFirst, let's mix paint with water to have enough colorful liquids for the mixing extravaganza. We'll start with red, followed by yellow, blue, and white, and black will top it all off. These are all basic colors. Next, we'll use a dropper to fill a few spots in our special palette with those liquid paints. All we've left to do is knock ourselves out and mix them all up with each other, and again and again, mixing, matching, and varying the participants of those mixtures. Sound pretty fun, huh?\r\n\r\nSo, do you want to know the results of our experiment? Then hit play and watch this video till the very end.

Have you ever had a strange emotion you couldn't recognize straight away?\r\n\r\nSammy has just played some video games with Roger and lost for the third time in a row. He felt strange, but only with the help of Roger could Sammy understand that he was envious. Sam didn't like that but Roger explained that it is completely OK to feel that way occasionally. The important thing is to channel all negative emotions in a positive way. That's just what we'll do in this video!\r\n\r\nToday, we will unbox quite a few amazing blind baggies and get acquainted with Envy, Disgust, Anger, and even Riley from that well-known animated movie. At that, we will give our new friend Riley a makeover using stuff we'll find inside the surprise baggies and have lots of fun along the way. And, a cherry on top - we will show you how we made such an amazing play set so you can easily recreate one for yourselves. Doesn't that sound marvelous?\r\n\r\nHit like and watch this video till the very end to engage in all the crafty fun.

She's a software engineer has worked in the field for more than a decade. Interestingly, she studied photography in school and never took a programming class.\n\nWe talk about:\n\n- How she and her sister ran a dial-in Bulletin Board System (BBS) back in the pre-web days\n\n- How her first year as a dev she \"was just living in abject fear of losing my job.\"\n\n- How she stayed at her first developer agency job for 7 years, and went from imposter syndrome afflicted newbie to getting promoted\n\n- Her philosophy on creating programming tutorials: \"You don't have to be on the cutting edge. I don't operate on the cutting edge.\"\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1993 rock song.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.

Though I don't agree with everything he says, I am right there with him on AI and how it's useful but over-hyped. We'll see what future versions hold and whether a \"Moore's Law of AI\" is really at work here, or whether it will plateau.\n\nI also agree with Prime that devs need to slow down and improve their foundational skills.

She was able to study history at the London School of Economics, before working in higher ed. She left her job to raise two kids due to the high cost of childcare in the UK, and spent years self-studying coding before becoming a software developer at age 36.\n\nI recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails. As with all my podcast episodes, I start by performing a classic bass line. Can you guess what song this bass line is from? It's from 1989.\n\nPhoebe has earned multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp, and also published a number of articles on our publication.\n\nHow Phoebe went from stay-at-home mom to Front End Web Developer at age 36: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-went-from-stay-at-home-mum-to-front-end-web-developer-39724046692a/\n\nPhoebe's review of Harvard CS50: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cs50-course-review/\n\nThe BBC Take-away Kids documentary, which Phoebe said is what her childhood was like, working from age 12: https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-47007812\n\nPhoebe's website, with her portfolio and links to her socials: https://www.thecodinghamster.com/\n\nüéâ Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\nüëæ davthecoder\nüëæ jedi-or-sith\nüëæ ÂçóÂÆÆÂçÉÂΩ±\nüëæ Agust√≠n Kussrow\nüëæ Nattira Maneerat\nüëæ Heather Wcislo\nüëæ Serhiy Kalinets\nüëæ Justin Hual\nüëæ Otis Morgan \nüëæ Oscar Rahnama\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news",

In no way does this project reflect an adherence to the same beliefs or ideologies as any other specific creator featured.  Over the years, it has been an honor to work with talented creators from all walks of life, as we firmly believe that exposure to diverse viewpoints is what cultivates both a genuine respect for others and a healthy conviction towards one's own worldview.\n\nCAST (in order of appearance)\nCaleb W.

Enjoy this blast from the past.\n\nFollow my socials ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì\nTwitter/Instagram: @GeorgeNotFound\n\nMerch: https://georgenotfound.shop\n\nI decided to live inside of Minecraft for 150 days. I couldn't take the headset off. Not to eat, drink, sleep, nothing. I woke up, and went to bed, fully immersed in Minecraft. This was an insane journey. It took me over 2 years to fully edit and put together this video.\n\nAfter a long 2023 with no uploads, a lot of stress, and me finally moving to America, I'm excited to return to uploading on YouTube! I have so many ideas. This video occupied a big spot in my mind even when I wasn't working on it. There was over 50 hours of footage to go through and edit! I'm very glad I finished it, and extremely proud of how it turned out :)\n\nIt was very touching to go through and relive some of these fun memories and moments with friends, years later. Hopefully it's a blast from the past and reminds everyone of 2021, and some of the awesome memories we all made online during lockdown.

If this video gets 100,000 likes I'll release the Minecraft world download from this video. This video was recorded in September 2021 so I don't actually know what version it was on lol. It could have been 1.17 or 1.18 idk\n\nSong used in intro: @JVKE - \"this is what space feels like\"\nThanks so much for letting me use your song!",
