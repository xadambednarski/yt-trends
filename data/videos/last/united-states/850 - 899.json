In the days before electricity, you needed matches to light your candles, your lamps, your stove so you could cook, and even your fireplace so you wouldn‚Äôt freeze to death. Many considered matches to be *the most* important item in the home.\n\nBut‚Ä¶ ironically‚Ä¶ the history of matches is *dark.* Making matches often led to slow, painful deaths. And workers who didn‚Äôt die had to live with brutal, face-altering injuries for the rest of their lives. And, it led to a legendary strike that changed worker‚Äôs rights forever. \n\nI appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.\n\nWant some cool Bailey Merch?\nShop Dark History Merch: https://www.baileysarian.com\n\n_________\n\nFOLLOW ME AROUND \nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BaileySarian\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE: cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails: baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nBusiness Related Mail: \nBailey Sarian \n4400 W.

Well... for one woman named Dolly... there was no such thing as \"too far.\" I mean... I gotta hand it to her. This woman knew what she wanted romantically and she went and got it.\n\nBut at a certain point, Dolly's thirst for steamy, sultry romance turned into something much more sinister. And a whole bunch of men got caught up in her web of destruction.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:03 - EARLY LIFE & MARRIAGE\n07:00 - DOLLY TAKES A LOVER\n10:17 - THE ATTIC CONDITIONS & FRED'S SUSPICIONS \n12:04 - THE MOVE TO L.A.\n14:18 - MOMENT!\n16:18 - A FATEFUL FIGHT\n19:44 - THE GRIEVING WIDOW'S STORY COLLAPSES\n23:30 - OTTER'S CONFESSION & DOLLY'S CHARGES\n26:24 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  :\n\nFACE\n\n-Neogen Calming Micellar Cleansing Oil\nhttps://bit.ly/4fjeXrs\n\n-Neogen Calming Cicatree Micellar Cleansing Foam\nhttps://howl.link/t160aamhz496r\n\n-Neogen Bio-Peel + Gauze Peeling Wine\nhttps://howl.link/okje9m9bfp93u\n\n-Neogen Hyal Glow Rose Essence\nhttps://howl.link/mkmh6y00qic30\n\n-Neogen Real Heartleaf Soothing Daily Mask\n‚Äã‚Äãhttps://howl.link/qdguzzg8w6bms\n\n-d‚ÄôAlba White Truffle Double Serum & Cream\nhttps://howl.link/75265zpoki922\n\nEYES\n\n-Neogen Extra Clear Eye Remover\nhttps://bit.ly/3O2RjDq\n\n-Peter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\nhttps://howl.link/vxjpi07ua6qg5\n\n-Saturday Skin Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream\nhttps://howl.link/gzwu379dm0qwl\n\nLIPS\n\n-La Roch-Posay Cicaplast Lips Hydration Restore Lip Balm\nhttps://howl.link/e8mdfq4w0s3f7",

Aaron Hernandez has been all over the place recently because a new TV show came out about him. And I remember hearing about this guy in the news... but I never really knew all the details. Until now... \n\nFriends... the Aaron Hernandez is a ride. His story goes from the highest of highs - playing in the fricken Super Bowl - to the lowest of lows - locked up for a horrible a crime. From fame and fortune, to murder in cold blood - this story is unforgettable.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time. Hope you have a great rest of your week, make good choices and I'll be seeing you very soon\nxo\nBailey Sarian\n\n_________\n\n:  :    F O L L O W    M E     :  :\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.com/invite/BaileySarian\nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE : cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails : Baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nWanna Send Me Something?\nBailey Sarian\n4400 W Riverside Dr Ste 110-300,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\n_________\n\nCHAPTERS: \n00:00 - INTRO\n04:31 - EARLY LIFE\n10:09 - AARON'S FOOTBALL JOURNEY & EXPOSURE TO DRUGS\n18:03 - \"A SOCIAL MISFIT\"\n21:32 - AARON IN THE NFL\n26:49 - A MASSIVE OVERREACTION\n30:57 - FEELING INVINCIBLE & A SECOND ATTEMPT\n35:56 - A FAILED SETTLEMENT\n39:11 - A SLOPPY JOB\n44:04 - THE MEDIA & AARON'S ARREST\n46:59 - CHARGES PILE UP\n49:18 - KARMA, CONSEQUENCES, & TRIAL\n52:29 - AARON'S CONFESSIONS & 2ND TRIAL\n55:32 - AN UNTIMELY END, STRATEGIES, & CTE\n1:03:42 - CLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n_________\n\n:  :   PRODUCTS USED  :  : \n\nBROWS \n\n-LA Girl Pro Conceal Concealer - ‚ÄúClassic Ivory‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtggkI79G\n\n-Viseart Structure Brow & Eyeshadow Palette\nDiscontinued :(\n\nFACE\n\n-Elf Suntouchable Whoa Glow Sun Protection & Makeup Primer\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtmo4SJMf\n\n-Elf Bronzing Drops Bronze + Nourish\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtmPnIt2M\n\n-MAC Studio Fix Fluid - ‚ÄúNW25‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtpA6ifpo\n\n-MAC Full Coverage Foundation - ‚ÄúNW20‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtqCXW1jt\n\n-Lunar Beauty Moon Prism Liquid Blush - ‚ÄúPumpkin‚Äô Papi‚Äù\nhttps://bit.ly/3YApVCW\n\n-Bare Minerals Bare Pro Powder Foundation -‚ÄùLight 20 Neutral‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtsQn6uIV\n\n-OFRA Highlighter - ‚ÄúMoondance‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmttVZgBAj\n\n-Maybelline Fit Me Loose Finishing Powder - ‚Äú20 Light Medium‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtuKk6tuh\n\n\nEYES \n\n-LA Girl Pro Conceal Concealer - ‚ÄúClassic Ivory‚Äù (Used as eye primer)\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtggkI79G\n\n-Huda Beauty Creamy Neutral Brown Palette\nhttps://howl.me/cnmtvyrWcAY\n\n-Oden‚Äôs Eye Jewel Shine Eyeshadow - ‚ÄúS010 Lvy‚Äù\nhttps://bit.ly/3YAwGVm\n\n-Rimmel London Scandal Eyes Exaggerate Eyeliner - ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmyfPdF83k\n\n-Bold Face Makeup Lashes Super Stacked - ‚ÄúBigger is Better‚Äù\nhttps://bit.ly/4f7ruxI\n\n-Urban Decay 24/7 Glide on Eye Pencil - ‚ÄúRoxy‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmyvbP0GA1\n\nLIPS\n\n-Huda Beauty Lip Contour 2.0 - ‚ÄúPinky Brown‚Äù\nhttps://howl.me/cnmyw2lpZuS\n\n-Queen Cosmetics Hemp Infused Gloss - ‚ÄúStargazing‚Äù\nhttps://bit.ly/3BXMh8J",

And keeps me up at night. This is one of them.\n\nThe story of Ottis Toole (and his literal partner in crime Henry Lee Lucas) involves cannibalism, a cult and even a cameo by Ted Bundy. The horrific actions of Ottis even went on to help inspire the man who created of a TV show we all remember from our youth... America's Most Wanted.\n\nThe story of Ottis Toole is one you will not forget for a long time to come.\n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to talk about next time.

When I was going through my closet looking for Joan‚Äôs Halloween costumes, something fell from the shelf straight onto my head. It was my Ouija board. And look‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of spooky season or what, but it spooked me. \n\nI mean yeah, it‚Äôs *just* a board game‚Ä¶ but it *is* communicating with spirits...allegedly. It made me wonder‚Ä¶ why are we letting kids casually communicate with the dead? \n\nSo I got to searching. Turns out, there is a long, wild history behind the Ouija board, and some of America‚Äôs most popular board games. And a lot of their stories end in *murder.* \n\nI appreciate you for coming by, and tune in next week for more Dark History.\n\n_______\n\nWant some cool Bailey Merch?\nShop Dark History Merch: https://www.baileysarian.com\n\n_______\n\nYou can find the Dark History podcast on Apple, Spotify, wherever you listen to your podcasts, and every Thursday here on my YouTube for the visual side of things.\n\nApple Podcast- https://www.apple.co/darkhistory\nDark History Merch-  https://www.baileysarian.com\n_______\n\nFOLLOW ME AROUND \nTik Tok: https://bit.ly/3e3jL9v\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2nbO4PR\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/2mdZtK6\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2yT4BLV\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/2mVpXnY\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/1HGw3Og\nSnapchat: https://bit.ly/3cC0V9d\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/BaileySarian\n\nRECOMMEND A STORY HERE: cases4bailey@gmail.com \n\nBusiness Related Emails: baileysarianteam@wmeagency.com\n\nBusiness Related Mail: \nBailey Sarian \n4400 W.

Oscar Pistorius overcame all odds and went on to become both a Paralympic AND Olympic sensation. I mean... Oscar had the entire world in the palm of his hands.

I just had a thought! \nWe didn't even introduce ourselves!\nYou think THEY would want to be our new best friends?\nTotally!\nLet's hit it!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm Tia\nI'm Gia\nAnd it's really nice to meet ya\nI'm pretty sure you just became my new best friend\nI said I'm Tia \nAnd I'm Gia\nAnd it's really nice to meet ya \nAnd that's the story how I met my new best friend",

When an injury ends his amateur boxing career, Stuart Long (Mark Wahlberg) moves to L.A. dreaming of stardom. While scraping by as a supermarket clerk, he meets Carmen (Teresa Ruiz), a Catholic Sunday school teacher who seems immune to his bad-boy charm. Determined to win her over, the longtime agnostic starts going to church to impress her. But surviving a terrible motorcycle accident leaves him wondering if he can use his second chance to help others find their way, leading to the surprising realization that he is meant to be a Catholic priest. Despite a devastating health crisis and the skepticism of Church officials and his estranged parents (Mel Gibson and Jacki Weaver), Stu pursues his vocation with courage and compassion, inspiring not only those closest to him but countless others along the way.\n \nWritten for the screen and directed by Rosalind Ross, and starring Academy Award Nominee¬Æ Mark Wahlberg (Best Supporting Actor, The Departed, 2006) as Father Stu, along with Academy Award Winner¬Æ Mel Gibson (Best Director, Braveheart, 1995), Academy Award Nominee¬Æ Jacki Weaver (Best Supporting Actor, Silver Linings Playbook, 2012) and Teresa Ruiz (Narcos).

We think it's because of an idea called the wise woman hypothesis, says Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB/GYN and author. \n\nThe wise woman hypothesis describes the idea that historically for humans, having a grandmother in your family unit meant you had an extra pair of knowledgeable hands that themselves weren't occupied with child-rearing. Someone who could go out and help gather food, build shelter, find water, and pass on historical knowledge from other generations. \n\nAnd so menopause represents evolution in the long game, the idea that we retain our power as we age. Dr. Jen Gunter explains both the science and common myths behind the biological process of menopause, and how to know who to trust to guide you while going through it.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/menopause-explained/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nGo Deeper with Big Think:\n\n‚ñ∫Become a Big Think Member\nGet exclusive access to full interviews, early access to new releases, Big Think merch and more. https://members.bigthink.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n \n‚ñ∫Get Big Think+ for Business\nGuide, inspire and accelerate leaders at all levels of your company with the biggest minds in business. https://bigthink.com/plus/great-leaders-think-big/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Dr. Jen Gunter:\n\nDr. Jen Gunter is an OB/GYN and a pain medicine physician.

However, the positive effects may stem from avoiding overeating rather than restriction per se. Second, a plant-based diet, with less animal products and refined sugars and more fruits, veggies, and whole foods, seems beneficial for aging and longevity. Third, fasting, or limiting eating to specific time windows, might mimic the benefits of caloric restriction by causing 'hormesis', mild stressors that boost resilience to aging-related changes. \n\nThe optimal diet is likely individual, influenced by factors like genetics and age, and should be monitored through measures of biological age and personal well-being. Future research into aging biomarkers could further our understanding of diet's role in the aging process.\n\n0:00 Does diet affect aging?\n0:35 #1 Caloric restriction\n1:40 #2 What you eat\n2:07 #3 When you eat: fasting\n2:38 Hormesis: Building biological resilience\n3:16 What is the optimal diet for you?\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/great-question/aging-and-diet\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Morgan Levine: \nMorgan Levine was previously a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the department of Pathology at Yale University where she ran the Laboratory for Aging in Living Systems. In 2022, she was recruited to join Altos Labs as a Founding Principal Investigator at the San Diego Institute of Science. She currently leads a research group at Altos Labs working at the intersection of bioinformatics, cellular biology, complex systems, and biostatistics with the overall goal of understanding the molecular trajectories aging cells, tissues, and organisms take through time. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on aging: \nAging gratefully: Will you be happier in old age? ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/happiness-old-age/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description Blood test can calculate your true biological age ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/health/calculate-your-biological-age/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description The brain undergoes a great ‚Äúrewiring‚Äù after age 40 ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/great-brain-rewiring-after-age-40/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nOur mission is to make you smarter, faster.

This is a question that drives the work of Judith Butler, a gender theorist and distinguished professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \n\nWhile acknowledging the biological realities of sex, Butler promotes the concept of gender as performative ‚Äî something that is enacted and shaped through our actions and interactions. This view, although challenging to traditional perspectives, is instrumental in the discourse on queer, trans, and women's rights. Butler encourages a shift in societal conversation to include diverse gender identities. \n\nThis transformation, they believe, allows us to work toward a society where equality, freedom, and justice are at the forefront, reinforcing the foundations of our democratic society.\n\n0:00 What is gender theory?\n1:34 Sex and gender: What‚Äôs the difference?\n2:29 Learning from genocide\n3:34 Queer theory in the 1970s & ‚Äô80s\n4:56 Big ideas in gender theory‚Äôs evolution\n7:06 Gender is ‚Äúperformative‚Äù: What that means\n9:04 The resistance to trans rights\n10:37 Countering the attack on gender\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/legends/gender-theory/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Judith Butler:\nJudith Butler is a post-structuralist philosopher and queer theorist.

That‚Äôs how people should feel about important leadership positions, according to how political scientist Brian Klaas thinks about the role of power in society.\n\nKlaas says that power should be a burden on people because leaders have to make decisions that will ultimately have negative consequences for many people. One problem: some humans don‚Äôt care about those consequences. And, according to Klaas, our institutions don‚Äôt do a very good job of screening these people out of important leadership spots.\n\nKlaas suggests implementing psychological screening for top jobs, asking questions to determine why someone seeks power, and identifying whether they are in it for themselves or for the greater good. These measures can help to ensure that the right people are in positions of power, whether that means leading a company, governing a nation, or handling nuclear weapons.\n\n0:00 Power should be a burden / Power should keep you up at night\n1:18: The dark triad personality traits\n1:43 Machiavellianism\n2:06 Narcissism \n2:40 Psychopathy\n4:04 Psychological screening for powerful jobs\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/leaders-should-be-psych-tested/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Brian Klaas:\nAssociate Professor of Global Politics at University College London, Contributing Writer for The Atlantic, author of Corruptible: Who Gets Power and How It Changes Us, and Creator/Host of the award-winning Power Corrupts podcast.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on politics: \n6 great philosophers and how they used their political power\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/thinking/philosophers-political-power/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\nHow Russia‚Äôs strange cultural mindset led to Vladimir Putin‚Äôs great miscalculation\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/the-present/putin-great-miscalculation/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\nIntolerance of uncertainty drives liberals and conservatives to polarizing partisanship\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/the-present/political-polarization-2653027840/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=youtube_description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nOur mission is to make you smarter, faster.

Journalist Louise Perry thinks so. In her book, The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, Perry discusses the idea of sexual disenchantment, the commodification of sex, and the impact of the online porn industry on society.\n\nShe argues that the multibillion-dollar global industry is qualitatively different from past exposure to porn, as it normalizes extreme content and affects the sexual culture of an entire generation. Perry likens porn to \"super stimuli\" that tap into the natural drive for reproduction but exaggerate it in a maladaptive way, similar to fast food. She also critiques platforms like OnlyFans, noting that while it may appear to cut out the middleman, the platform itself still profits from sexual exploitation.\n\nPerry expresses concern that despite many people having a robust critique of capitalism in other industries like gambling or junk food, they hesitate to apply the same scrutiny to the porn industry. But that may be changing.\n\n0:00 Sexual disenchantment\n0:29 Sex: It‚Äôs not private, it‚Äôs networked\n1:06 A different beast: Digital porn\n2:03 The rise of strangulation\n3:07 Limbic capitalism & ‚Äúsuper stimuli‚Äù\n4:21 OnlyFans\n4:52 The porn industry\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/case-against-porn/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Louise Perry:\nLouise Perry is a writer and campaigner based in London, UK.

The tragedy of the commons describes a predicament in which individuals independently pursue their own interests, leading to the overexploitation and eventual depletion of a shared resource, ultimately harming everyone's well-being.\n\nAccording to Pinker, one example of a tragedy of the commons lies within what we choose to believe in public. An individual might be incentivized to believe in something because it will make them look good to people in their circle. But if enough people behave in this way, the likely consequence is that fewer people will be incentivized to earnestly search for truth.¬†\n\nStill, Pinker maintains a hopeful outlook. He cites advancements in science and morality as evidence of progress, and he argues that humanistic values hold an inherent advantage, as they appeal to universal human desires and shared experiences.\n\n0:00 Knowledge: It‚Äôs unnatural\n1:17 Game theory‚Äôs ‚Äòtragedy of the commons‚Äô\n1:59 The rationality commons\n2:55 Is there hope for civilization?\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/great-question/game-theory-378914/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Steven Pinker:\nSteven Pinker is an experimental psychologist who conducts research in visual cognition, psycholinguistics, and social relations.

Become antifragile ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/e-or_D-qNqM\n\nIn her book \"Good Power,\" former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty challenges the negative connotations often associated with the concept of power. She argues that power can be a force for good, and that building belief is at the heart of good power. Building belief involves creating an environment in which people voluntarily want to do something, rather than being ordered to do so out of fear. Rometty suggests that co-creating the future with others, rather than dictating it, is a key element of building belief. It is important to make the process personal by showing empathy for those involved and being authentic and honest about the challenges ahead.\n\nRometty draws on her own experiences to illustrate these principles. For example, when IBM acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting, she acknowledged the risks involved and showed empathy for the changes employees would have to go through. Ultimately, Rometty believes that building belief and empowering others ‚Äî rather than attempting to sway them with money ‚Äî is key to being a successful leader. She urges leaders to focus on building their own power first and then using that power to influence and inspire others toward a common goal.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/good-power/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Ginni Rometty:\nGinni Rometty was the ninth chairman, president, and CEO of IBM. Under her leadership, the 100-year-old company reinvented 50% of its portfolio, built a $25 billion hybrid cloud business, and established leadership in AI and quantum computing.\n\nRometty also drove record results in diversity and inclusion and supported the explosive growth of an innovative high school program to prepare the workforce of the future in more than twenty-eight countries. Through her work with the Business Roundtable, Rometty helped redefine the purpose of the corporation. She has been named Fortune's #1 Most Powerful Woman three years in a row, is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and was honored with the designation of Officier in the French L√©gion d'Honneur.\n\nToday Rometty serves on multiple boards and cochairs OneTen, a coalition committed to upskilling, hiring, and promoting one million Black Americans by 2030 into family-sustaining jobs and careers.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on leadership: \n15 leadership training topics for forward-thinking organizations\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/plus/leadership-training-topics/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\nHow to develop emotional intelligence training for leaders and managers\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/plus/emotional-intelligence-training-for-leaders/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\nInterpersonal skills training: 5 lessons for building people skills\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/plus/interpersonal-skills-training/?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=description\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nThe leading source of expert-driven, educational content.

Therefore, it's crucial to consider when Bayes' theorem is applicable and when it's not.\n\n0:00 What is Bayesian thinking?\n1:01 The formula\n2:41 When Bayes‚Äô theorem obscures the solution\n4:25 Bayes‚Äô theorem in a nutshell\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/bayes-rule\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Steven Pinker:\nSteven Pinker is an experimental psychologist who conducts research in visual cognition, psycholinguistics, and social relations.

In general, women have far greater legal and economic power in marriages than they did just decades ago, and while it was once difficult for women to file for divorce, today women do so at twice the rate of men. What‚Äôs more, gay marriage has been legal in all 50 states since 2015.\n\nStill, other aspects of marriage in the U.S. have remained remarkably unchanged. As journalist and Brookings Institution scholar Richard Reeves points out, a college-educated woman today is about just as likely to get married as her mother was ‚Äî and even a bit more likely to stay married.\n\nBut the same is not true for Americans on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. As Reeves notes in this Big Think video, it‚Äôs important for all humans to have strong and meaningful relationships, whether within the context of marriage or not. The question is how to best ensure that the most people can build those relationships.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/great-question/is-marriage-dying\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Richard Reeves:\nRichard V. Reeves is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, where he directs the Future of the Middle Class Initiative and co-directs the Center on Children and Families. His Brookings research focuses on the middle class, inequality and social mobility.\n\nRichard writes for a wide range of publications, including the New York Times, Guardian, National Affairs, The Atlantic, Democracy Journal, and Wall Street Journal. He is the author of Dream Hoarders (Brookings Institution Press, 2017), and John Stuart Mill ‚Äì Victorian Firebrand (Atlantic Books, 2007), an intellectual biography of the British liberal philosopher and politician.\n\nDream Hoarders was named a Book of the Year by The Economist, a Political Book of the Year by The Observer, and was shortlisted for the Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social Justice. In September 2017, Politico magazine named Richard one of the top 50 thinkers in the U.S. for his work on class and inequality.\n\nA Brit-American, Richard was director of strategy to the UK‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2012. Other previous roles include director of Demos, the London-based political think-tank; social affairs editor of the Observer; principal policy advisor to the Minister for Welfare Reform, and research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Richard is also a former European Business Speaker of the Year and has a BA from Oxford University and a PhD from Warwick University.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on relationships: \nMarried people earn more than single individuals.

In other words, we need a personal system for collecting, organizing, and retrieving information from both physical and digital environments.\n\nAlthough many people spend hours of their day on digital knowledge work, most are not getting better at managing their information. Instead, they‚Äôre becoming increasingly overwhelmed. Forte suggests approaching knowledge work with a process that can be improved upon, through the concept of divergence and convergence.\n\nIn practice, this means considering many options and then eliminating them, followed by creative and productive work. To maintain peace of mind, it's important to have multiple projects going on at once, which a second brain can help with by storing all projects in a concrete medium, freeing your memory.\n\n0:00 What is a second brain?\n1:14 Master divergence & convergence\n3:18 Be productive and calm\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/divergent-and-convergent-thinking\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Tiago Forte:\nTiago Forte is one of the world‚Äôs foremost experts on productivity.

The course draws on his experience in academic disciplines such as information science, practical fields such as user experience design, and his work with top organizations and leaders in Silicon Valley. Tiago believes knowledge management is one of the most impactful skills in the world today, and his work is dedicated to making it accessible to individuals for the first time. \n\nIn a previous life, he worked in microfinance in Latin America, served in the Peace Corps in Ukraine, and consulted for large companies on product development in San Francisco.

This still-unsolved question was posed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and the concept came to be known as the arrow of time.\n\nAs theoretical physicist @SabineHossenfelder explains, there's a longstanding mystery in the foundations of physics: If we look at the laws for microscopic constituents, like elementary particles, they work the same way forward in time as they do backward in time.

He notes that while we use the word \"time\" frequently in everyday language, the real puzzles arise when we consider the properties of time, such as the past, present, and future, and the fact that we can affect the future but not the past. \n\nCarroll also discusses the concept of entropy, which is a measure of how disorganized or random a system is, and the second law of thermodynamics, which states that there is a natural tendency for things in the universe to go from a state of low entropy to high entropy. He explains that the arrow of time, or the perceived difference between the past and the future, arises due to the influence of the Big Bang and the fact that the universe began in a state of low entropy. \n\nCarroll also touches on the possibility of time travel and the concept of the multiverse.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/the-Big-Bang-gave-us-time\n\n0:00 What is time?\n1:32 How the Big Bang gave us time \n3:31 How entropy creates the experience of time\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Sean Carroll:\nDr. Sean Carroll is Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy ‚Äî in effect, a joint appointment between physics and philosophy ‚Äî at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and fractal faculty at the Santa Fe Institute. Most of his career has been spent doing research on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation, looking at topics such as dark matter and dark energy, modified gravity, topological defects, extra dimensions, and violations of fundamental symmetries. These days, his focus has shifted to more foundational questions, both in quantum mechanics (origin of probability, emergence of space and time) and statistical mechanics (entropy and the arrow of time, emergence and causation, dynamics of complexity), bringing a more philosophical dimension to his work.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on the Big Bang: \nWhy we‚Äôll never see back to the beginning of the Universe\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/never-see-beginning-universe/\nThe Big Bang no longer means what it used to\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/big-bang-meaning/\nHow to prove the Big Bang with an old TV set\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/big-bang-old-tv/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nThe leading source of expert-driven, educational content.

Candidates who are well-prepared often pass these interviews, but this only tests their preparation and not their abilities.\n\nTo identify the best candidates, Cowen suggests that interviewers focus on being authentic and spontaneous in their interactions with candidates, instead of relying on pre-written questions.\n\nThe interviewer should be trustworthy, Cowen argues, as it helps them to better evaluate the candidate's authenticity. Ultimately, allocating talent in better ways can contribute to economic growth, and a more thoughtful approach to interviews can help identify more talented individuals and elevate them to greater opportunities.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫mhttps://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/how-to-interview\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Tyler Cowen:\nTyler is the Holbert L.

In 2011, Bloomberg Businessweek profiled Tyler as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Hottest Economist‚Äù after his e-book, The Great Stagnation, appeared twice on The New York Times e-book bestseller list.\n\nHe graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor's degree in economics and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. He also runs a podcast series called Conversations with Tyler. His latest book Talent: How to Identify Energizers, Creatives and Winners Around the World is co-authored with venture capitalist Daniel Gross.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on leadership: \nGreat leaders ask great questions: Here are 3 steps to up your questioning game.\n‚ñ∫https://bigthink.com/leadership/the-skill-of-questioning/\nWhy our instincts about innovation and change work against us\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/leadership/the-human-element/\nHow Stoicism can inspire fearless leadership\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/leadership/courage-is-calling/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nThe leading source of expert-driven, educational content.

To Roger, people often think war and business is all about numbers and hard data. But in reality, it‚Äôs often just as important to think about more qualitative aspects about your company and its competition.

Since the 1800s, scientists have known that entropy is always increasing, with everything in our Universe trending toward disorder over time.\n\nA more nuanced understanding of entropy is helping today's scientists make progress on the question of the origin of life, as Sean Carroll explains in this Big Think video.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/great-question/entropy-origin-of-life/\n\n0:00 Entropy: The 2nd law of thermodynamics\n1:56 The two axes: Chaos & complexity\n2:40 How did life emerge?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Sean Carroll:\nDr. Sean Carroll is Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy ‚Äî in effect, a joint appointment between physics and philosophy ‚Äî at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and fractal faculty at the Santa Fe Institute. Most of his career has been spent doing research on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation, looking at topics such as dark matter and dark energy, modified gravity, topological defects, extra dimensions, and violations of fundamental symmetries. These days, his focus has shifted to more foundational questions, both in quantum mechanics (origin of probability, emergence of space and time) and statistical mechanics (entropy and the arrow of time, emergence and causation, dynamics of complexity), bringing a more philosophical dimension to his work.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on the origin of life:\nWhat we wish we knew about the origin of life\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/origin-of-life-169450/\nCan science explain the beginning of the Universe?\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/13-8/origin-universe/\nAsk Ethan: Did all life begin from a single, ancient cell?\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/life-begin-cell/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nThe leading source of expert-driven, educational content.

During his time in space, Garan conducted four spacewalks in support of ISS construction and maintenance. Prior to those space journeys, he lived and conducted research on the bottom of the ocean in the world‚Äôs only undersea research lab, Aquarius.\n\nBefore reaching the summit of his career, Garan, a former test pilot and graduate of the US Naval Test Pilot School, taught hundreds of elite fighter pilots how to \"up their game\" as a flight instructor at the prestigious USAF Fighter Weapons School, the Air Force version of TOP GUN. He is the author of the critically acclaimed books: The Orbital Perspective, Floating in Darkness: A Journey of Evolution, and the children‚Äôs book, Railroad to the Moon.

After all, having productive debates is how people have learned, resolved conflicts, and generated new solutions for thousands of years. In Ancient Greece, it was even considered a kind of civic duty to be able to persuasively argue your point about the various issues of the day.\n\nThere are plenty of skilled rhetoricians around today. But as two-time world debate champion Bo Seo told Big Think, it has become rare to see thoughtful, productive, and smart debates broadcast on a large scale to the general public. We more often encounter short video clips or tweets featuring people whose main goal is to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the argument instead of trying to understand and refute the opposing side‚Äôs ideas in good faith.\n\nA major part of the problem is that we have outsourced our debates to avatars we see in media: politicians, pundits, and celebrities.\n\nSo, can we develop better models of disagreement to help us become better debaters?

But, Genova says, there's ways we can improve our memory, increase resilience and recall and be more comfortable with ourselves and our minds. \n\nFrom making lists and getting Google's help to giving yourself a pop quiz, getting some meditation in, and just plain paying attention, these tips will have your steel trap gleaming.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/memory-tips\n\n0:00 Introducing the problem\n1:19 #1: Practice paying attention\n1:45: #2: Bulk up your hippocampus\n3:18 A 9-second meditation you can try\n3:59 #3 Secure your sleep\n5:14 #4 Drink caffeine\n5:36 #5 Create associations (the Baker-Baker Paradox)\n6:36 #6 Repetition\n7:14 #7 Write it down\n8:03 #8 Self-testing\n8:31 #9 Just Google it\n9:14 Forgetting is human\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Lisa Genova:\nLisa Genova is the New York Times bestselling author of the novels Still Alice, Left Neglected, Love Anthony, Inside the O‚ÄôBriens, and Every Note Played.

Case in point: the treadmill. If our main goal was enjoyment, there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôd regularly spend 45 minutes walking in place on these expensive machines.\n\nBut our relationship with exercise ‚Äî or, more generally, physical activity ‚Äî was not always so discrete and joyless. For much of human history, people got plenty of physical activity by not only walking long distances, but also by doing activities that were both necessary and socially rewarding, like hunting, dancing, and sports.\n\nHarvard biologist Daniel Lieberman argues it‚Äôs time to rethink our relationship with exercise, and to understand physical activity as a complex and integral part of human evolution. After all, while walking thousands of steps through the environment to find our next meal was a major part of our evolution, walking on the treadmill was not.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/rethinking-exercise\n\n0:00 Treadmill torture (really)\n1:54 Exercise vs physical activity\n2:40 Why exercise stresses us out\n3:12 ‚ÄúMedicalizing‚Äù exercise\n3:48 The 10,000 steps myth\n5:02 Warrior origins of exercise\n6:12 Aggression: Proactive vs. reactive\n7:15 The anthropological view\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Daniel Lieberman:\nDaniel Lieberman is Edwin M.

His learnings may surprise you.\n\nSubscribe to Big Think on YouTube ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg?sub_confirmation=1\nUp next, Evolution explains kindness‚Äîeven when it kills us ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/Gy5hejk4vl4\n\nWhat do you imagine life was like for hunter-gatherers throughout human history? You might guess that daily life for them was a constant struggle between eating and being eaten in a world where surviving was a full-time job.\n\nBut anthropological research suggests that probably wasn‚Äôt the case. When the anthropologist James Suzman went to the Kalahari Desert to study the Ju/'hoansi hunter-gathers, for example, he found that they worked only 15 hours per week, and that much of that time was spent on activities that many people in the modern West consider leisure, like hiking and fishing.\n\nOf course, hunter-gatherers experienced plenty of hard times throughout world history. But a general theme has emerged from anthropological research on hunter-gathers both contemporary and ancient: Rather than being a constant battle for energy between people and their environment, life was more of a continuous flow of give and take between species, and leisure was part of the fabric of daily life.\n\nAs Suzman told Big Think, looking at the lives of hunter-gatherers can help us rethink the ways we conceptualize work and society.\n\nSelect footage supplied by Exploring Namibia TV ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/c/ExploringNamibiaTV\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/hunter-gatherer-society/\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout James Suzman:\nWith a head full of Laurens van der Post and half an anthropology degree from St Andrews University under his belt, James Suzman hitched a ride into Botswana‚Äôs eastern Kalahari in June 1991.

A big hit on the stock market; a hockey sticking cryptocurrency; an app that can put you on the path to easy street. But truly building financial independence is a life-long process, says Paula Pant, the host of the Afford Anything podcast. \n\nThink of your finances like a tree. While the leaves and fruit are grabby and exciting, they aren't where the tree's strength lies: that's in the roots. So too do healthy finances begin from a core base: figuring out what you value most, what you truly want to afford. \n\nFrom there, you can make the long term plans to see that come to fruition.

Free will, it was long thought, cannot exist in a world where all events are already causally determined.\n\nBut free will and determinism aren‚Äôt necessarily mutually exclusive.

One answer seems to center on how the drugs spark communication between different brain regions. What‚Äôs more, psychedelics seem to encourage greater neuroplasticity, meaning the brain becomes primed to learn new things in the wake of a psychedelic experience.\n\nCheck out this Big Think interview with Matthew Johnson, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University who explains how psychedelics work, and what researchers hope to uncover about the substances in the future.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/series/explain-it-like-im-smart/how-psychedelics-work/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Matthew Johnson:\nMatthew W.

From the anxieties of comparing yourself to others online to our fetishization of success, it can seem like everyone else is out there attaining their goals and feeling happy while you feel stuck.\n\nThe reality is that many people feel stuck ‚Äî even those who present themselves as models of conventional success. So, what are some ways you can meaningfully work toward your goals, while also making sure that your goals are worth pursuing in the first place?\n\nTodd Rose, the co-founder and president of the think tank Populace, offers a framework called the ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù mindset. As a rejection of conventional wisdom about how to succeed, the mindset includes four main strategies: know your micromotives, know your choices, know your strategies, and ignore the destination.\n\nWeighing in on those strategies and broader questions about success are other Big Think contributors, including Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, and Alex Banayan.\n\nRead the video transcript ‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/how-to-build-a-success-mindset/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n0:43 What is a 'dark horse'?\n1:20 Dark horse lesson #1: Know your micro-motives\n2:09 Neil deGrasse Tyson's mindset\n2:57 Dark horse lesson #2: Know your choices\n3:12 Steven Spielberg's mindset\n6:06 Dark horse lesson #3: Know your strategies\n6:30 Michio Kaku: Eisenhower's mindset\n7:42 Dark horse lesson #4: Ignore the destination\n8:15 Sarah Robb O'Hagan's mindset\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nRead more of our stories on success: \nThe paradoxical reasons for science‚Äôs success\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/hard-science/science-paradox-success/\nFour key rules for successful leadership\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/leadership/key-rules-for-leadership/ \nUpskilling: The key to success in the new world of work\n‚ñ∫ https://bigthink.com/plus/upskilling/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAbout Big Think | Smarter Faster‚Ñ¢\n‚ñ∫ Big Think \nThe leading source of expert-driven, educational content.

As it cooks, give it a rough chop up so it breaks apart into smaller pieces. Remove from heat once cooked 90% of the way through. Set aside to cool.\n\nThen in a bowl mix the egg, cheese, @FlavCity plant-based Protein Smoothie, baking powder, and psyllium husk.\n\nOnce the sausage is cooled, add it to the batter and mix once\nmore.\n\nPreheat a ceramic waffle maker, then spray with some avocado oil. Add the batter directly to the middle of the waffle maker and spread it out just a bit in an even circle.\n\nSlowly close the lid and cook it for 2-3 minutes or until it's nice and golden.\n\nServe with marinara sauce or maple syrup! Enjoy",

We recently found out about her gender reveal party, and there was no way I was going to miss it. Thanks to Cricut for sponsoring this video!\n\nAbba has always been really good at surprising me, so I decided to return the favor and surprise her just in time for her gender reveal party. Before heading out,I used my Cricut to craft ‚ÄúTeam Girl‚Äù t-shirts for rylan and I to wear to the party (we were 100% confident!) But we had so much fun catching and celebrating her pregnancy together! \n\n‚ù§Ô∏è's - Brooklyn\n\nCricut + Accessories i used: \nhttps://urlgeni.us/amazon/twKY3\nhttps://urlgeni.us/amazon/mDAqV\n\nYou can check out our shop HERE: www.lashnextdoor.com\n\nDon't forget to follow us on other platforms where we post daily!\n   üì∏  Instagram | http://instagram.com/brooklynandbailey\n   ‚è∞  Tik Tok | @BrooklynAndBailey\n   üê•  Twitter | http://twitter.com/brookandbailey\n   üë§  Facebook | http://facebook.com/brooklynandbailey\n   üëª  SnapChat | http://snapchat.com/add/BrookAndBailey\n   üé∂  Spotify | https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Y8tcJEqYuIDSNAZEqu9Nd\n   ‚òÅÔ∏è  SoundCloud | http://soundcloud.com/brooklynandbailey\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is a sponsored video.\n\n\nüí•HELP US OUTüí•: You can help us translate our uploads, and get credit below each video!
